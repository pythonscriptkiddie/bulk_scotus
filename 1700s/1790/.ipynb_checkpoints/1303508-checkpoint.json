The bequest was made to a person who was always called Samuel by the testator, though, in fact, named William; and whom the testator had nurtured and educated from his infancy; when, on the other hand, he did not even know the person really called Samuel. The evidence to explain those facts was proper to be laid before the jury; and their verdict perfectly accords with the law and equity of the case. Therefore,</p>\n<p>Let the Rule be discharged.</p>\n</div>",
