To prove the alledged mistake, imposition, or deceit, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*430</span> deeds or other writings, which are not the immediate foundation of the suit, but only leading to it, may be read.</p>\n<p>We are all, therefore, of opinion, that a new trial ought not to be granted.</p>\n<p>Judgment for the Plaintiff.</p>\n</div>",
