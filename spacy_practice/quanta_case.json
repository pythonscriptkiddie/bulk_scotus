In this case, we decide whether patent exhaustion applies to the sale of components of a patented system that must be combined with additional components in order to practice the patented methods. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the doctrine does not apply to method patents at all and, in the alternative, that it does not apply here because the sales were not authorized by the license agreement. We disagree on both scores. Because the exhaustion doctrine applies to method patents, and because the license authorizes the sale of components that substantially embody the patents in suit, the sale exhausted the patents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondent LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE), purchased a portfolio of computer technology patents in 1999, including the three patents at issue here: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,939,641 ('641); 5,379,379 ('379); and 5,077,733 ('733) (collectively LGE Patents). The main functions of a computer system are carried out on a microprocessor, or central processing unit, which interprets program instructions, processes data, and controls other devices in the system. A set of wires, or bus, connects the microprocessor to a chipset, which transfers data between the microprocessor and other devices, including the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive, memory, and disk drives.</p>\n<p>The data processed by the computer are stored principally in random access memory, also called main memory. Webster's New World Dictionary of Computer Terms 334, 451 (8th ed.2000). Frequently accessed data are generally stored in cache memory, which permits faster access than main memory and is often located on the microprocessor itself. <i>Id.,</i> at 84. When copies of data are stored in both the cache and main memory, problems may arise when one copy is changed but the other still contains the original \"stale\" version of the data. J. Handy, Cache Memory Book 124 (2d ed.1993). The '641 patent addresses this problem. It discloses a system for ensuring that the most current data are retrieved from main memory by monitoring data requests and updating main memory from the cache when stale data are requested. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc.,</i> 453 F.3d 1364, 1377 (C.A.Fed.2006).</p>\n<p>The '379 patent relates to the coordination of requests to read from, and write to, main memory. <i>Id.,</i> at 1378. Processing these requests in chronological order can slow down a system because read requests are faster to execute than write requests. Processing all read requests first ensures speedy access, but may result in the retrieval of outdated data if a read request for a certain piece of data is processed before an outstanding write request for the same data. The '379 patent discloses an efficient method of organizing read and write requests while maintaining accuracy by allowing the computer to execute only read requests until it needs data for which there is an outstanding write request. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.,</i> No. C 01-02187 CW et al., Order Construing Disputed Terms and Phrases, p. 42 (ND Cal., Aug. 20, 2002). Upon receiving such a read request, the computer executes pending write requests first and only then returns to the read requests so that the most up-to-date data are retrieved. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The '733 patent addresses the problem of managing the data traffic on a bus connecting two computer components, so <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2114</span> that no one device monopolizes the bus. It allows multiple devices to share the bus, giving heavy users greater access. This patent describes methods that establish a rotating priority system under which each device alternately has priority access to the bus for a preset number of cycles and heavier users can maintain priority for more cycles without \"hogging\" the device indefinitely. <i>Id.,</i> at 37-38.</p>\n<p>LGE licensed a patent portfolio, including the LGE Patents, to Intel Corporation (Intel). The cross-licensing agreement (License Agreement) permits Intel to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets that use the LGE Patents (the Intel Products). The License Agreement authorizes Intel to \"`make, use, sell (directly or indirectly), offer to sell, import or otherwise dispose of'\" its own products practicing the LGE Patents. Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 154).<sup>[1]</sup> Notwithstanding this broad language, the License Agreement contains some limitations. Relevant here, it stipulates that no license</p>\n<blockquote>\"`is granted by either party hereto . . . to any third party for the combination by a third party of Licensed Products of either party with items, components, or the like acquired . . . from sources other than a party hereto, or for the use, import, offer for sale or sale of such combination.'\" Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 164).</blockquote>\n<p>The License Agreement purports not to alter the usual rules of patent exhaustion, however, providing that, \"`[n]otwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.'\" Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 164).</p>\n<p>In a separate agreement (Master Agreement), Intel agreed to give written notice to its own customers informing them that, while it had obtained a broad license \"`ensur[ing] that any Intel product that you purchase is licensed by LGE and thus does not infringe any patent held by LGE,'\" the license \"`does not extend, expressly or by implication, to any product that you make by combining an Intel product with any non-Intel product.'\" Brief for Respondent 9 (emphasis deleted) (quoting App. 198). The Master Agreement also provides that \"`a breach of this Agreement shall have no effect on and shall not be grounds for termination of the Patent License.'\" Brief for Petitioners 9 (quoting App. 176).</p>\n<p>Petitioners, including Quanta Computer (collectively Quanta), are a group of computer manufacturers. Quanta purchased microprocessors and chipsets from Intel and received the notice required by the Master Agreement. Nonetheless, Quanta manufactured computers using Intel parts in combination with non-Intel memory and buses in ways that practice the LGE Patents. Quanta does not modify the Intel components and follows Intel's specifications to incorporate the parts into its own systems.</p>\n<p>LGE filed a complaint against Quanta, asserting that the combination of the Intel Products with non-Intel memory and buses infringed the LGE Patents. The District Court granted summary judgment to Quanta, holding that, for purposes of the patent exhaustion doctrine, the license LGE granted to Intel resulted in forfeiture of any potential infringement actions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2115</span> against legitimate purchasers of the Intel Products. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.,</i> 65 USPQ 2d 1589, 1593, 1600 (N.D.Cal.2002). The court found that, although the Intel Products do not fully practice any of the patents at issue, they have no reasonable noninfringing use and therefore their authorized sale exhausted patent rights in the completed computers under <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> 316 U.S. 241, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 86 L.Ed. 1408 (1942). <i>Asustek, supra,</i> at 1598-1600. In a subsequent order limiting its summary judgment ruling, the court held that patent exhaustion applies only to apparatus or composition-of-matter claims that describe a physical object, and does not apply to process, or method, claims that describe operations to make or use a product. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.,</i> 248 F.Supp.2d 912, 918 (N.D.Cal.2003). Because each of the LGE Patents includes method claims, exhaustion did not apply.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. It agreed that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not apply to method claims. In the alternative, it concluded that exhaustion did not apply because LGE did not license Intel to sell the Intel Products to Quanta for use in combination with non-Intel products. 453 F.3d, at 1370.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 28, 168 L.Ed.2d 805 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item. This Court first applied the doctrine in 19th-century cases addressing patent extensions on the Woodworth planing machine. Purchasers of licenses to sell and use the machine for the duration of the original patent term sought to continue using the licenses through the extended term. The Court held that the extension of the patent term did not affect the rights already secured by purchasers who bought the item for use \"in the ordinary pursuits of life.\" <i>Bloomer v. McQuewan,</i> 14 How. 539, 549, 14 L.Ed. 532 (1853); see also <i>ibid.</i> (\"[W]hen the machine passes to the hands of the purchaser, it is no longer within the limits of the monopoly\"); <i>Bloomer v. Millinger,</i> 1 Wall. 340, 351, 17 L.Ed. 581 (1864). In <i>Adams v. Burke,</i> 17 Wall. 453, 21 L.Ed. 700 (1873), the Court affirmed the dismissal of a patent holder's suit alleging that a licensee had violated postsale restrictions on where patented coffin-lids could be used. \"[W]here a person ha[s] purchased a patented machine of the patentee or his assignee,\" the Court held, \"this purchase carrie[s] with it the right to the use of that machine so long as it [is] capable of use.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 455.</p>\n<p>Although the Court permitted postsale restrictions on the use of a patented article in <i>Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.,</i> 224 U.S. 1, 32 S.Ct. 364, 56 L.Ed. 645 (1912),<sup>[2]</sup> that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2116</span> decision was short lived. In 1913, the Court refused to apply <i>A.B. Dick</i> to uphold price-fixing provisions in a patent license. See <i>Bauer &amp; Cie v. O'Donnell,</i> 229 U.S. 1, 14-17, 33 S.Ct. 616, 57 L.Ed. 1041 (1913). Shortly thereafter, in <i>Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.,</i> 243 U.S. 502, 518, 37 S.Ct. 416, 61 L.Ed. 871 (1917), the Court explicitly overruled <i>A.B. Dick.</i> In that case, a patent holder attempted to limit purchasers' use of its film projectors to show only film made under a patent held by the same company. The Court noted the \"increasing frequency\" with which patent holders were using <i>A.B. Dick</i>-style licenses to limit the use of their products and thereby using the patents to secure market control of related, unpatented items. 243 U.S., at 509, 516-517, 37 S.Ct. 416. Observing that \"the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents but is `to promote the progress of science and useful arts,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 511, 37 S.Ct. 416 (quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8), the Court held that \"the scope of the grant which may be made to an inventor in a patent, pursuant to the [patent] statute, must be limited to the invention described in the claims of his patent.\" 243 U.S., at 511, 37 S.Ct. 416. Accordingly, it reiterated the rule that \"the right to vend is exhausted by a single, unconditional sale, the article sold being thereby carried outside the monopoly of the patent law and rendered free of every restriction which the vendor may attempt to put upon it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 516, 37 S.Ct. 416.</p>\n<p>This Court most recently discussed patent exhaustion in <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S. 241, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 86 L.Ed. 1408, on which the District Court relied. Univis Lens Company, the holder of patents on eyeglass lenses, licensed a purchaser to manufacture lens blanks<sup>[3]</sup> by fusing together different lens segments to create bi- and tri-focal lenses and to sell them to other Univis licensees at agreed-upon rates. Wholesalers were licensed to grind the blanks into the patented finished lenses, which they would then sell to Univis-licensed prescription retailers for resale at a fixed rate. Finishing retailers, after grinding the blanks into patented lenses, would sell the finished lenses to consumers at the same fixed rate. The United States sued Univis under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, 15, alleging unlawful restraints on trade. Univis asserted its patent monopoly rights as a defense to the antitrust suit. The Court granted certiorari to determine whether Univis' patent monopoly survived the sale of the lens blanks by the licensed manufacturer and therefore shielded Univis' pricing scheme from the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>The Court assumed that the Univis patents containing claims for finished lenses were practiced in part by the wholesalers and finishing retailers who ground the blanks into lenses, and held that the sale of the lens blanks exhausted the patents on the finished lenses. <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S., at 248-249, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The Court explained that the lens blanks \"embodi[ed] essential features of the patented device and [were] without utility until . . . ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote>\"where one has sold an uncompleted article which, because it embodies essential features of his patented invention, is within the protection of his patent, and has destined the article to be finished by the purchaser in conformity to the patent, he has sold his invention so far as it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2117</span> is or may be embodied in that particular article.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 250-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, the Court concluded that the traditional bar on patent restrictions following the sale of an item applies when the item sufficiently embodies the patent\u0097 even if it does not completely practice the patent\u0097such that its only and intended use is to be finished under the terms of the patent.</p>\n<p>With this history of the patent exhaustion doctrine in mind, we turn to the parties' arguments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>LGE argues that the exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable here because it does not apply to method claims, which are contained in each of the LGE Patents. LGE reasons that, because method patents are linked not to a tangible article but to a process, they can never be exhausted through a sale. Rather, practicing the patent\u0097which occurs upon each use of an article embodying a method patent\u0097is permissible only to the extent rights are transferred in an assignment contract. Quanta, in turn, argues that there is no reason to preclude exhaustion of method claims, and points out that both this Court and the Federal Circuit have applied exhaustion to method claims. It argues that any other rule would allow patent holders to avoid exhaustion entirely by inserting method claims in their patent specifications.</p>\n<p>Quanta has the better of this argument. Nothing in this Court's approach to patent exhaustion supports LGE's argument that method patents cannot be exhausted. It is true that a patented method may not be sold in the same way as an article or device, but methods nonetheless may be \"embodied\" in a product, the sale of which exhausts patent rights. Our precedents do not differentiate transactions involving embodiments of patented methods or processes from those involving patented apparatuses or materials. To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly held that method patents were exhausted by the sale of an item that embodied the method. In <i>Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States,</i> 309 U.S. 436, 446, 457, 60 S.Ct. 618, 84 L.Ed. 852 (1940), for example, the Court held that the sale of a motor fuel produced under one patent also exhausted the patent for a method of using the fuel in combustion motors.<sup>[4]</sup> Similarly, as previously described, <i>Univis</i> held that the sale of optical lens blanks that partially practiced a patent exhausted the method patents that were not completely practiced until the blanks were ground into lenses. 316 U.S., at 248-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</p>\n<p>These cases rest on solid footing. Eliminating exhaustion for method patents would seriously undermine the exhaustion doctrine. Patentees seeking to avoid patent exhaustion could simply draft their patent claims to describe a method rather than an apparatus.<sup>[5]</sup> Apparatus and method <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2118</span> claims \"may approach each other so nearly that it will be difficult to distinguish the process from the function of the apparatus.\" <i>United States ex rel. Steinmetz v. Allen,</i> 192 U.S. 543, 559, 24 S.Ct. 416, 48 L.Ed. 555 (1904). By characterizing their claims as method instead of apparatus claims, or including a method claim for the machine's patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.</p>\n<p>This case illustrates the danger of allowing such an end-run around exhaustion. On LGE's theory, although Intel is authorized to sell a completed computer system that practices the LGE Patents, any downstream purchasers of the system could nonetheless be liable for patent infringement. Such a result would violate the longstanding principle that, when a patented item is \"once lawfully made and sold, there is no restriction on [its] <i>use</i> to be implied for the benefit of the patentee.\" <i>Adams,</i> 17 Wall., at 457, 21 L.Ed. 700. We therefore reject LGE's argument that method claims, as a category, are never exhaustible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We next consider the extent to which a product must embody a patent in order to trigger exhaustion. Quanta argues that, although sales of an incomplete article do not necessarily exhaust the patent in that article, the sale of the microprocessors and chipsets exhausted LGE's patents in the same way the sale of the lens blanks exhausted the patents in <i>Univis.</i> Just as the lens blanks in <i>Univis</i> did not fully practice the patents at issue because they had not been ground into finished lenses, Quanta observes, the Intel Products cannot practice the LGE Patents\u0097or indeed, function at all\u0097until they are combined with memory and buses in a computer system. If, as in <i>Univis,</i> patent rights are exhausted by the sale of the incomplete item, then LGE has no postsale right to require that the patents be practiced using only Intel parts. Quanta also argues that exhaustion doctrine will be a dead letter unless it is triggered by the sale of components that essentially, even if not completely, embody an invention. Otherwise, patent holders could authorize the sale of computers that are complete with the exception of one minor step\u0097say, inserting the microprocessor into a socket\u0097 and extend their rights through each downstream purchaser all the way to the end user.</p>\n<p>LGE, for its part, argues that <i>Univis</i> is inapplicable here for three reasons. First, it maintains that <i>Univis</i> should be limited to products that contain all the physical aspects needed to practice the patent. On that theory, the Intel Products cannot embody the patents because additional physical components are required before the patents can be practiced. Second, LGE asserts that in <i>Univis</i> there was no \"patentable distinction\" between the lens blanks and the patented finished lenses since they were both subject to the same patent. Brief for Respondent 14 (citing <i>Univis, supra,</i> at 248-252, 62 S.Ct. 1088). In contrast, it describes the Intel Products as \"independent and distinct products\" from the systems using the LGE Patents and subject to \"independent patents.\" Brief for Respondent 13. Finally, LGE argues that <i>Univis</i> does not apply because the Intel Products are analogous to individual elements of a combination patent, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2119</span> and allowing sale of those components to exhaust the patent would impermissibly \"ascrib[e] to one element of the patented combination the status of the patented invention in itself.\" <i>Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.,</i> 365 U.S. 336, 344-345, 81 S.Ct. 599, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961).</p>\n<p>We agree with Quanta that <i>Univis</i> governs this case. As the Court there explained, exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they \"embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention.\" 316 U.S., at 249-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088. Each of those attributes is shared by the microprocessors and chipsets Intel sold to Quanta under the License Agreement.</p>\n<p>First, <i>Univis</i> held that \"the authorized sale of an article which is capable of use only in practicing the patent is a relinquishment of the patent monopoly with respect to the article sold.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The lens blanks in <i>Univis</i> met this standard because they were \"without utility until [they were] ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, \"the only object of the sale [was] to enable the [finishing retailer] to grind and polish it for use as a lens by the prospective wearer.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Here, LGE has suggested no reasonable use for the Intel Products other than incorporating them into computer systems that practice the LGE Patents.<sup>[6]</sup> Nor can we can discern one: A microprocessor or chipset cannot function until it is connected to buses and memory. And here, as in <i>Univis,</i> the only apparent object of Intel's sales to Quanta was to permit Quanta to incorporate the Intel Products into computers that would practice the patents.</p>\n<p>Second, the lens blanks in <i>Univis</i> \"embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 250-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The essential, or inventive, feature of the Univis lens patents was the fusing together of different lens segments to create bi- and tri-focal lenses. The finishing process performed by the finishing and prescription retailers after the fusing was not unique. As the United States explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The finishing licensees finish Univis lens blanks in precisely the same manner as they finish all other bifocal lens blanks. Indeed, appellees have never contended that their licensing system is supported by patents covering methods or processes relating to the finishing of lens blanks. Consequently, it appears that appellees perform all of the operations which contribute any claimed element of novelty to Univis lenses.\" Brief for United States in <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> O.T.1941, No. 855 et al., p. 10 (footnote and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>While the Court assumed that the finishing process was covered by the patents, <i>Univis, supra,</i> at 248-249, 62 S.Ct. 1088, and the District Court found that it was necessary to make a working lens, <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> 41 F.Supp. 258, 262-263 (S.D.N.Y.1941), the grinding process <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2120</span> was not central to the patents. That standard process was not included in detail in any of the patents and was not referred to at all in two of the patents. Those that did mention the finishing process treated it as incidental to the invention, noting, for example, that \"[t]he blank is then ground in the usual manner,\" U.S. Patent No. 1,876,497, p. 2, or simply that the blank is \"then ground and polished,\" U.S. Patent No. 1,632,208, p. 1, Tr. of Record in <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> O.T.1941, No. 855 et al., pp. 516, 498.</p>\n<p>Like the Univis lens blanks, the Intel Products constitute a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practice the patent. Here, as in <i>Univis,</i> the incomplete article substantially embodies the patent because the only step necessary to practice the patent is the application of common processes or the addition of standard parts. Everything inventive about each patent is embodied in the Intel Products. They control access to main and cache memory, practicing the '641 and '379 patents by checking cache memory against main memory and comparing read and write requests. They also control priority of bus access by various other computer components under the '733 patent. Naturally, the Intel Products cannot carry out these functions unless they are attached to memory and buses, but those additions are standard components in the system, providing the material that enables the microprocessors and chipsets to function. The Intel Products were specifically designed to function only when memory or buses are attached; Quanta was not required to make any creative or inventive decision when it added those parts. Indeed, Quanta had no alternative but to follow Intel's specifications in incorporating the Intel Products into its computers because it did not know their internal structure, which Intel guards as a trade secret. Brief for Petitioners 3. Intel all but practiced the patent itself by designing its products to practice the patents, lacking only the addition of standard parts.</p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded by LGE's attempts to distinguish <i>Univis.</i> First, there is no reason to distinguish the two cases on the ground that the articles in Univis required the <i>removal</i> of material to practice the patent while the Intel Products require the <i>addition</i> of components to practice the patent. LGE characterizes the lens blanks and lenses as sharing a \"basic nature\" by virtue of their physical similarity, while the Intel Products embody only some of the \"patentably distinct elements and steps\" involved in the LGE Patents. Brief for Respondent 26-27. But we think that the nature of the final step, rather than whether it consists of adding or deleting material, is the relevant characteristic. In each case, the final step to practice the patent is common and noninventive: grinding a lens to the customer's prescription, or connecting a microprocessor or chipset to buses or memory. The Intel Products embody the essential features of the LGE Patents because they carry out all the inventive processes when combined, according to their design, with standard components.</p>\n<p>With regard to LGE's argument that exhaustion does not apply across patents, we agree on the general principle: The sale of a device that practices patent A does not, by virtue of practicing patent A, exhaust patent B. But if the device practices patent A <i>while substantially embodying</i> patent B, its relationship to patent A does not prevent exhaustion of patent B. For example, if the Univis lens blanks had been composed of shatter-resistant glass under patent A, the blanks would nonetheless have substantially embodied, and therefore exhausted, patent B for the finished lenses. This case is no different. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2121</span> While each Intel microprocessor and chipset practices thousands of individual patents, including some LGE patents not at issue in this case, the exhaustion analysis is not altered by the fact that more than one patent is practiced by the same product. The relevant consideration is whether the Intel Products that partially practice a patent\u0097by, for example, embodying its essential features\u0097exhaust <i>that</i> patent.</p>\n<p>Finally, LGE's reliance on <i>Aro</i> is misplaced because that case dealt only with the question whether replacement of one part of a patented combination infringes the patent. First, the replacement question is not at issue here. Second, and more importantly, <i>Aro</i> is not squarely applicable to the exhaustion of patents like the LGE Patents that do not disclose a new combination of existing parts. <i>Aro</i> described combination patents as \"cover[ing] only the totality of the elements in the claim [so] that no element, separately viewed, is within the grant.\" 365 U.S., at 344, 81 S.Ct. 599; see also <i>Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co.,</i> 320 U.S. 661, 667-668, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376 (1944) (noting that, in a combination patent, \"the combination is the invention and it is distinct from any\" of its elements). <i>Aro's</i> warning that no element can be viewed as central to or equivalent to the invention is specific to the context in which the combination itself is the only inventive aspect of the patent. In this case, the inventive part of the patent is not the fact that memory and buses are combined with a microprocessor or chipset; rather, it is included in the design of the Intel Products themselves and the way these products access the memory or bus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that the Intel Products embodied the patents, we next consider whether their sale to Quanta exhausted LGE's patent rights. Exhaustion is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder. <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S., at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</p>\n<p>LGE argues that there was no authorized sale here because the License Agreement does not permit Intel to sell its products for use in combination with non-Intel products to practice the LGE Patents. It cites <i>General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.,</i> 304 U.S. 175, 58 S.Ct. 849, 82 L.Ed. 1273 (1938), and <i>General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.,</i> 305 U.S. 124, 59 S.Ct. 116, 83 L.Ed. 81 (1938), in which the manufacturer sold patented amplifiers for commercial use, thereby breaching a license that limited the buyer to selling the amplifiers for private and home use. The Court held that exhaustion did not apply because the manufacturer had no authority to sell the amplifiers for commercial use, and the manufacturer \"could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell.\" <i>General Talking Pictures, supra,</i> at 181, 58 S.Ct. 849. LGE argues that the same principle applies here: Intel could not convey to Quanta what both knew it was not authorized to sell, <i>i.e.,</i> the right to practice the patents with non-Intel parts.</p>\n<p>LGE overlooks important aspects of the structure of the Intel-LGE transaction. Nothing in the License Agreement restricts Intel's right to sell its microprocessors and chipsets to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-Intel parts. It broadly permits Intel to \"`make, use, [or] sell'\" products free of LGE's patent claims. Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 154). To be sure, LGE did require Intel to give notice to its customers, including Quanta, that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents. But neither party contends that Intel breached the agreement in that respect. Brief for Petitioners 9; Brief for Respondent 9. In any event, the provision requiring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2122</span> notice to Quanta appeared only in the Master Agreement, and LGE does not suggest that a breach of that agreement would constitute a breach of the License Agreement. Hence, Intel's authority to sell its products embodying the LGE Patents was not conditioned on the notice or on Quanta's decision to abide by LGE's directions in that notice.</p>\n<p>LGE points out that the License Agreement specifically disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents by combining licensed products with other components. Brief for Petitioners 8. But the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns only on Intel's own license to sell products practicing the LGE Patents.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, LGE invokes the principle that patent exhaustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on \"making\" an article. Brief for Respondent 43. But this is simply a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel Products with other components adds more than standard finishing to complete a patented article. As explained above, making a product that substantially embodies a patent is, for exhaustion purposes, no different from making the patented article itself. In other words, no further \"making\" results from the addition of standard parts\u0097here, the buses and memory\u0097to a product that already substantially embodies the patent.</p>\n<p>The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the LGE Patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. Because Intel was authorized to sell its products to Quanta, the doctrine of patent exhaustion prevents LGE from further asserting its patent rights with respect to the patents substantially embodied by those products.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The authorized sale of an article that substantially embodies a patent exhausts the patent holder's rights and prevents the patent holder from invoking patent law to control postsale use of the article. Here, LGE licensed Intel to practice any of its patents and to sell products practicing those patents. Intel's microprocessors and chipsets substantially embodied the LGE Patents because they had no reasonable noninfringing use and included all the inventive aspects of the patented methods. Nothing in the License Agreement limited Intel's ability to sell its products practicing the LGE Patents. Intel's authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  App. 145-198 is sealed; where material contained therein also appears in the parties' unsealed briefs, citations are to the latter.</p>\n<p>[2]  The A.B.

The only requirement, the Court held, was that \"the purchaser must have notice that he buys with only a qualified right of use,\" so that a sale made without conditions resulted in \"an unconditional title to the machine, with no limitations upon the use.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 26, 32 S.Ct. 364.</p>\n<p>[3]  Lens blanks are \"rough opaque pieces of glass of suitable size, design and composition for use, when ground and polished, as multi-focal lenses in eyeglasses.\" <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S., at 244, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</p>\n<p>[4]  The patentee held patents for (1) a fluid additive increasing gasoline efficiency, (2) motor fuel produced by mixing gasoline with the patented fluid, and (3) a method of using fuel containing the patented fluid in combustion motors. <i>Ethyl Gasoline Corp.,</i> 309 U.S., at 446, 60 S.Ct. 618. The patentee sold only the fluid, but attempted to control sales of the treated fuel. <i>Id.,</i> at 459, 60 S.Ct. 618.

Brief for Respondent 21-22, n. 10. But <i>Univis</i> teaches that the question is whether the product is \"capable of use only in <i>practicing</i> the patent,\" not whether those uses are infringing. 316 U.S., at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088 (emphasis added). Whether outside the country or functioning as replacement parts, the Intel Products would still be <i>practicing</i> the patent, even if not infringing it. And since the features partially practicing the patent are what must have an alternative use, suggesting that they be disabled is no solution. The disabled features would have no real <i>use.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  We note that the authorized nature of the sale to Quanta does not necessarily limit LGE's other contract rights. LGE's complaint does not include a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on whether contract damages might be available even though exhaustion operates to eliminate patent damages.

LG ELECTRON-\n                ICS, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 06\u2013937.      Argued January 16, 2008\u2014Decided June 9, 2008\nThe longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion limits the patent rights\n  that survive the initial authorized sale of a patented item. Respon-\n  dent (LGE) purchased, inter alia, the computer technology patents at\n  issue (LGE Patents): One discloses a system for ensuring that most\n  current data are retrieved from main memory, one relates to the co-\n  ordination of requests to read from and write to main memory, and\n  one addresses the problem of managing data traffic on a set of wires,\n  or \u201cbus,\u201d connecting two computer components. LGE licensed the\n  patents to Intel Corporation (Intel), in an agreement (License Agree-\n  ment) that authorizes Intel to manufacture and sell microprocessors\n  and chipsets using the LGE Patents (Intel Products) and that does\n  not purport to alter patent exhaustion rules. A separate agreement\n  (Master Agreement) required Intel to give its customers written no-\n  tice that the license does not extend to a product made by combining\n  an Intel Product with a non-Intel product, and provided that a\n  breach of the agreement would not affect the License Agreement. Pe-\n  titioner computer manufacturers (Quanta) purchased microproces-\n  sors and chipsets from Intel. Quanta then manufactured computers\n  using Intel parts in combination with non-Intel parts, but did not\n  modify the Intel components. LGE sued, asserting that this combina-\n  tion infringed the LGE Patents. The District Court granted Quanta\n  summary judgment, but on reconsideration, denied summary judg-\n  ment as to the LGE Patents because they contained method claims.\n  The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, agreeing\n  with the District Court that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not\n  apply to method patents, which describe operations to make or use a\n  product; and concluding, in the alternative, that exhaustion did not\n2       QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    apply because LGE did not license Intel to sell the Intel Products to\n    Quanta to combine with non-Intel products.\nHeld: Because the doctrine of patent exhaustion applies to method pat-\n ents, and because the License Agreement authorizes the sale of com-\n ponents that substantially embody the patents in suit, the exhaus-\n tion doctrine prevents LGE from further asserting its patent rights\n with respect to the patents substantially embodied by those products.\n Pp. 5\u201319.\n    (a) The patent exhaustion doctrine provides that a patented item\u2019s\n initial authorized sale terminates all patent rights to that item. See,\n e.g., Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539. In the Court\u2019s most recent\n discussion of the doctrine, United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U. S.\n 241, patents for finished eyeglass lenses, held by the respondent\n (Univis), did not survive the sale of lens blanks by the licensed manu-\n facturer to wholesalers and finishing retailers who ground the blanks\n into patented finished lenses. The Court assumed that Univis\u2019 pat-\n ents were practiced in part by the wholesalers and finishing retailers,\n concluding that the traditional bar on patent restrictions following an\n item\u2019s sale applies when the item sufficiently embodies the patent\u2014\n even if it does not completely practice the patent\u2014such that its only\n and intended use is to be finished under the patent\u2019s terms. The par-\n ties\u2019 arguments here are addressed with this patent exhaustion his-\n tory in mind. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) Nothing in this Court\u2019s approach to patent exhaustion supports\n LGE\u2019s argument that method claims, as a category, are never ex-\n haustible. A patented method may not be sold in the same way as an\n article or device, but methods nonetheless may be \u201cembodied\u201d in a\n product, the sale of which exhausts patent rights. The Court has re-\n peatedly found method patents exhausted by the sale of an item em-\n bodying the method. See Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, 309\n U. S. 436, 446, 457; Univis, supra, at 248\u2013251. These cases rest on\n solid footing. Eliminating exhaustion for method patents would seri-\n ously undermine the exhaustion doctrine, since patentees seeking to\n avoid exhaustion could simply draft their claims to describe a method\n rather than an apparatus. On LGE\u2019s theory here, for example, al-\n though Intel is authorized to sell a completed computer system that\n practices the LGE Patents, downstream purchasers could be liable\n for patent infringement, which would violate the longstanding prin-\n ciple that, when a patented item is \u201conce lawfully made and sold,\n there is no restriction on [its] use to be implied for the [patentee\u2019s]\n benefit,\u201d Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453, 457. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    (c) The Intel Products embodied the patents here. Univis governs\n this case. There, exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens\n blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to prac-\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tice the patent and because they \u201cembodie[d] essential features of\n  [the] patented invention,\u201d 316 U. S., at 249\u2013251. Each of those at-\n  tributes is shared by the microprocessors and chipsets Intel sold to\n  Quanta under the License Agreement. First, LGE has suggested no\n  reasonable use for the Intel Products other than incorporating them\n  into computer systems that practice the LGE Patents: A microproces-\n  sor or chipset cannot function until it is connected to buses and mem-\n  ory. And as in Univis, the only apparent object of Intel\u2019s sales was to\n  permit Quanta to incorporate the Intel Products into computers that\n  would practice the patents. Second, like the Univis lens blanks, the\n  Intel Products constitute a material part of the patented invention\n  and all but completely practice the patent. The only step necessary\n  to practice the patent is the application of common processes or the\n  addition of standard parts. Everything inventive about each patent\n  is embodied in the Intel Products. LGE\u2019s attempts to distinguish\n  Univis are unavailing. Pp. 11\u201316.\n     (d) Intel\u2019s sale to Quanta exhausted LGE\u2019s patent rights. Exhaus-\n  tion is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder.\n  Univis, supra, at 249. LGE argues that this sale was not authorized\n  because the License Agreement does not permit Intel to sell its prod-\n  ucts for use in combination with non-Intel products to practice the\n  LGE Patents. But the License Agreement does not restrict Intel\u2019s\n  right to sell its products to purchasers who intend to combine them\n  with non-Intel parts. Intel was required to give its customers notice\n  that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents,\n  but neither party contends that Intel breached that agreement. In\n  any event, the notice provision is in the Master Agreement, and LGE\n  does not suggest that a breach of that agreement would constitute a\n  License Agreement breach. Contrary to LGE\u2019s position, the question\n  whether third parties may have received implied licenses is irrele-\n  vant, because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based\n  not on implied license but on exhaustion, and exhaustion turns only\n  on Intel\u2019s own license to sell products practicing the LGE Patents.\n  LGE\u2019s alternative argument, invoking the principle that patent ex-\n  haustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on \u201cmaking\u201d an arti-\n  cle, is simply a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel\n  Products with other components adds more than standard finishing\n  to complete a patented article.

In this case,\nwe decide whether patent exhaustion applies to the sale of\ncomponents of a patented system that must be combined\nwith additional components in order to practice the pat-\nented methods. The Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit held that the doctrine does not apply to method\npatents at all and, in the alternative, that it does not\napply here because the sales were not authorized by the\nlicense agreement. We disagree on both scores. Because\nthe exhaustion doctrine applies to method patents, and\nbecause the license authorizes the sale of components that\nsubstantially embody the patents in suit, the sale ex-\nhausted the patents.\n                             I\n  Respondent LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE), purchased a\nportfolio of computer technology patents in 1999, including\nthe three patents at issue here: U. S. Patent Nos.\n4,939,641 (\u2019641); 5,379,379 (\u2019379); and 5,077,733 (\u2019733)\n2    QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(collectively LGE Patents). The main functions of a com-\nputer system are carried out on a microprocessor, or cen-\ntral processing unit, which interprets program instruc-\ntions, processes data, and controls other devices in the\nsystem. A set of wires, or bus, connects the microprocessor\nto a chipset, which transfers data between the microproc-\nessor and other devices, including the keyboard, mouse,\nmonitor, hard drive, memory, and disk drives.\n   The data processed by the computer are stored princi-\npally in random access memory, also called main memory.\nWebster\u2019s New World Dictionary of Computer Terms 334,\n451 (8th ed. 2000). Frequently accessed data are generally\nstored in cache memory, which permits faster access than\nmain memory and is often located on the microprocessor\nitself. Id., at 84. When copies of data are stored in both\nthe cache and main memory, problems may arise when\none copy is changed but the other still contains the origi-\nnal \u201cstale\u201d version of the data. J. Handy, Cache Memory\nBook 124 (2d ed. 1993). The \u2019641 patent addresses this\nproblem. It discloses a system for ensuring that the most\ncurrent data are retrieved from main memory by monitor-\ning data requests and updating main memory from the\ncache when stale data are requested. LG Electronics, Inc.\nv. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F. 3d 1364, 1377 (CA Fed.\n2006).\n   The \u2019379 patent relates to the coordination of requests to\nread from, and write to, main memory. Id., at 1378.\nProcessing these requests in chronological order can slow\ndown a system because read requests are faster to execute\nthan write requests. Processing all read requests first\nensures speedy access, but may result in the retrieval of\noutdated data if a read request for a certain piece of data\nis processed before an outstanding write request for the\nsame data. The \u2019379 patent discloses an efficient method\nof organizing read and write requests while maintaining\naccuracy by allowing the computer to execute only read\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

Asustek\nComputer, Inc., No. C 01\u201302187 CW et al., Order Constru-\ning Disputed Terms and Phrases, p. 42 (ND Cal., Aug. 20,\n2002). Upon receiving such a read request, the computer\nexecutes pending write requests first and only then re-\nturns to the read requests so that the most up-to-date data\nare retrieved. Ibid.\n   The \u2019733 patent addresses the problem of managing the\ndata traffic on a bus connecting two computer components,\nso that no one device monopolizes the bus. It allows mul-\ntiple devices to share the bus, giving heavy users greater\naccess. This patent describes methods that establish a\nrotating priority system under which each device alter-\nnately has priority access to the bus for a preset number of\ncycles and heavier users can maintain priority for more\ncycles without \u201chogging\u201d the device indefinitely. Id., at\n37\u201338.\n   LGE licensed a patent portfolio, including the LGE\nPatents, to Intel Corporation (Intel).

The District\nCourt granted summary judgment to Quanta, holding\nthat, for purposes of the patent exhaustion doctrine, the\nlicense LGE granted to Intel resulted in forfeiture of any\npotential infringement actions against legitimate purchas-\ners of the Intel Products. LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek\nComputer, Inc., 65 USPQ 2d 1589, 1593, 1600 (ND Cal.\n2002). The court found that, although the Intel Products\ndo not fully practice any of the patents at issue, they have\nno reasonable noninfringing use and therefore their au-\nthorized sale exhausted patent rights in the completed\ncomputers under United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316\nU. S. 241 (1942). Asustek, supra, at 1598\u20131600. In a\nsubsequent order limiting its summary judgment ruling,\nthe court held that patent exhaustion applies only to\napparatus or composition-of-matter claims that describe a\nphysical object, and does not apply to process, or method,\nclaims that describe operations to make or use a product.\nLG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc., 248\nF. Supp. 2d 912, 918 (ND Cal. 2003). Because each of the\nLGE Patents includes method claims, exhaustion did not\napply.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. It agreed that the doctrine of\npatent exhaustion does not apply to method claims. In the\nalternative, it concluded that exhaustion did not apply\nbecause LGE did not license Intel to sell the Intel Products\nto Quanta for use in combination with non-Intel products.\n453 F. 3d, at 1370.\n   We granted certiorari, 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                             II\n  The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides\nthat the initial authorized sale of a patented item termi-\nnates all patent rights to that item. This Court first ap-\nplied the doctrine in 19th-century cases addressing patent\n6       QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nextensions on the Woodworth planing machine. Purchas-\ners of licenses to sell and use the machine for the duration\nof the original patent term sought to continue using the\nlicenses through the extended term. The Court held that\nthe extension of the patent term did not affect the rights\nalready secured by purchasers who bought the item for\nuse \u201cin the ordinary pursuits of life.\u201d Bloomer v. McQue-\nwan, 14 How. 539, 549 (1853); see also ibid. (\u201c[W]hen the\nmachine passes to the hands of the purchaser, it is no\nlonger within the limits of the monopoly\u201d); Bloomer v.\nMillinger, 1 Wall. 340, 351 (1864). In Adams v. Burke, 17\nWall. 453 (1873), the Court affirmed the dismissal of a\npatent holder\u2019s suit alleging that a licensee had violated\npostsale restrictions on where patented coffin-lids could be\nused. \u201c[W]here a person ha[s] purchased a patented ma-\nchine of the patentee or his assignee,\u201d the Court held, \u201cthis\npurchase carrie[s] with it the right to the use of that ma-\nchine so long as it [is] capable of use.\u201d Id., at 455.\n   Although the Court permitted postsale restrictions on\nthe use of a patented article in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co.,\n224 U. S. 1 (1912),2 that decision was short lived. In 1913,\nthe Court refused to apply A. B. Dick to uphold price-\nfixing provisions in a patent license. See Bauer & Cie v.\nO\u2019Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, 14\u201317 (1913). Shortly thereafter,\nin Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.,\n243 U. S. 502, 518 (1917), the Court explicitly overruled\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The A. B. Dick Company sold mimeograph machines with an at-\ntached license stipulating that the machine could be used only with ink,\npaper, and other supplies made by the A. B. Dick Company. The Court\nrejected the notion that a patent holder \u201ccan only keep the article\nwithin the control of the patent by retaining the title,\u201d A. B. Dick, 224\nU. S., at 18, and held that \u201cany . . . reasonable stipulation, not inher-\nently violative of some substantive law\u201d was \u201cvalid and enforceable,\u201d\nid., at 31. The only requirement, the Court held, was that \u201cthe pur-\nchaser must have notice that he buys with only a qualified right of use,\u201d\nso that a sale made without conditions resulted in \u201can unconditional\ntitle to the machine, with no limitations upon the use.\u201d Id., at 26.\n                    Cite as: 553 U.

In that case, a patent holder attempted to\nlimit purchasers\u2019 use of its film projectors to show only\nfilm made under a patent held by the same company. The\nCourt noted the \u201cincreasing frequency\u201d with which patent\nholders were using A. B. Dick-style licenses to limit the\nuse of their products and thereby using the patents to\nsecure market control of related, unpatented items. 243\nU. S., at 509, 516\u2013517. Observing that \u201cthe primary pur-\npose of our patent laws is not the creation of private for-\ntunes for the owners of patents but is \u2018to promote the\nprogress of science and useful arts,\u2019 \u201d id., at 511 (quoting\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8), the Court held that \u201cthe\nscope of the grant which may be made to an inventor in a\npatent, pursuant to the [patent] statute, must be limited\nto the invention described in the claims of his patent.\u201d 243\nU. S., at 511. Accordingly, it reiterated the rule that \u201cthe\nright to vend is exhausted by a single, unconditional sale,\nthe article sold being thereby carried outside the monopoly\nof the patent law and rendered free of every restriction\nwhich the vendor may attempt to put upon it.\u201d Id., at 516.\n   This Court most recently discussed patent exhaustion in\nUnivis, 316 U. S. 241, on which the District Court relied.\nUnivis Lens Company, the holder of patents on eyeglass\nlenses, licensed a purchaser to manufacture lens blanks3\nby fusing together different lens segments to create bi-\nand tri-focal lenses and to sell them to other Univis licen-\nsees at agreed-upon rates. Wholesalers were licensed to\ngrind the blanks into the patented finished lenses, which\nthey would then sell to Univis-licensed prescription retail-\ners for resale at a fixed rate. Finishing retailers, after\ngrinding the blanks into patented lenses, would sell the\nfinished lenses to consumers at the same fixed rate. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Lens blanks are \u201crough opaque pieces of glass of suitable size, de-\n\nsign and composition for use, when ground and polished, as multifocal\nlenses in eyeglasses.\u201d Univis, 316 U. S., at 244.\n8    QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States sued Univis under the Sherman Act, 15\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71, 3, 15, alleging unlawful restraints on trade.\nUnivis asserted its patent monopoly rights as a defense to\nthe antitrust suit. The Court granted certiorari to deter-\nmine whether Univis\u2019 patent monopoly survived the sale of\nthe lens blanks by the licensed manufacturer and there-\nfore shielded Univis\u2019 pricing scheme from the Sherman\nAct.\n  The Court assumed that the Univis patents containing\nclaims for finished lenses were practiced in part by the\nwholesalers and finishing retailers who ground the blanks\ninto lenses, and held that the sale of the lens blanks ex-\nhausted the patents on the finished lenses. Univis, 316\nU. S., at 248\u2013249. The Court explained that the lens\nblanks \u201cembodi[ed] essential features of the patented\ndevice and [were] without utility until . . . ground and\npolished as the finished lens of the patent.\u201d Id., at 249.\nThe Court noted that:\n    \u201cwhere one has sold an uncompleted article which, be-\n    cause it embodies essential features of his patented\n    invention, is within the protection of his patent, and\n    has destined the article to be finished by the pur-\n    chaser in conformity to the patent, he has sold his in-\n    vention so far as it is or may be embodied in that par-\n    ticular article.\u201d Id., at 250\u2013251.\nIn sum, the Court concluded that the traditional bar on\npatent restrictions following the sale of an item applies\nwhen the item sufficiently embodies the patent\u2014even if it\ndoes not completely practice the patent\u2014such that its only\nand intended use is to be finished under the terms of the\npatent.\n  With this history of the patent exhaustion doctrine in\nmind, we turn to the parties\u2019 arguments.\n                      Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   LGE argues that the exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable\nhere because it does not apply to method claims, which are\ncontained in each of the LGE Patents. LGE reasons that,\nbecause method patents are linked not to a tangible article\nbut to a process, they can never be exhausted through a\nsale. Rather, practicing the patent\u2014which occurs upon\neach use of an article embodying a method patent\u2014is\npermissible only to the extent rights are transferred in an\nassignment contract. Quanta, in turn, argues that there is\nno reason to preclude exhaustion of method claims, and\npoints out that both this Court and the Federal Circuit\nhave applied exhaustion to method claims. It argues that\nany other rule would allow patent holders to avoid exhaus-\ntion entirely by inserting method claims in their patent\nspecifications.\n   Quanta has the better of this argument. Nothing in this\nCourt\u2019s approach to patent exhaustion supports LGE\u2019s\nargument that method patents cannot be exhausted. It is\ntrue that a patented method may not be sold in the same\nway as an article or device, but methods nonetheless may\nbe \u201cembodied\u201d in a product, the sale of which exhausts\npatent rights. Our precedents do not differentiate trans-\nactions involving embodiments of patented methods or\nprocesses from those involving patented apparatuses or\nmaterials. To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly held\nthat method patents were exhausted by the sale of an item\nthat embodied the method. In Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v.\nUnited States, 309 U. S. 436, 446, 457 (1940), for example,\nthe Court held that the sale of a motor fuel produced\nunder one patent also exhausted the patent for a method\nof using the fuel in combustion motors.4 Similarly, as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The patentee held patents for (1) a fluid additive increasing gasoline\n\nefficiency, (2) motor fuel produced by mixing gasoline with the patented\n10    QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npreviously described, Univis held that the sale of optical\nlens blanks that partially practiced a patent exhausted the\nmethod patents that were not completely practiced until\nthe blanks were ground into lenses. 316 U. S., at 248\u2013251.\n   These cases rest on solid footing. Eliminating exhaus-\ntion for method patents would seriously undermine the\nexhaustion doctrine. Patentees seeking to avoid patent\nexhaustion could simply draft their patent claims to de-\nscribe a method rather than an apparatus.5 Apparatus\nand method claims \u201cmay approach each other so nearly\nthat it will be difficult to distinguish the process from the\nfunction of the apparatus.\u201d United States ex rel. Steinmetz\nv. Allen, 192 U. S. 543, 559 (1904). By characterizing their\nclaims as method instead of apparatus claims, or including\na method claim for the machine\u2019s patented method of\nperforming its task, a patent drafter could shield practi-\ncally any patented item from exhaustion.\n   This case illustrates the danger of allowing such an end-\nrun around exhaustion. On LGE\u2019s theory, although Intel\nis authorized to sell a completed computer system that\npractices the LGE Patents, any downstream purchasers of\nthe system could nonetheless be liable for patent in-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nfluid, and (3) a method of using fuel containing the patented fluid in\ncombustion motors. Ethyl Gasoline Corp., 309 U. S., at 446. The\npatentee sold only the fluid, but attempted to control sales of the\ntreated fuel. Id., at 459. The Court held that the sale of the fluid to\nrefiners relinquished the patentee\u2019s exclusive rights to sell the treated\nfuel. Id., at 457.\n   5 One commentator recommends this strategy as a way to draft pat-\n\nent claims that \u201cwill survive numerous transactions regarding the\npatented good, allowing the force of the patent to intrude deeply into\nthe stream of commerce.\u201d Thomas, Of Text, Technique, and the Tangi-\nble: Drafting Patent Claims Around Patent Rules, 17 J. Marshall J.\nComputer & Info. L. 219, 252 (1998); see also id., at 225\u2013226 (advocat-\ning the conversion of apparatus claims into method claims and noting\nthat \u201c[e]ven the most novice claims drafter would encounter scant\ndifficulty in converting a patent claim from artifact to technique and\nback again\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfringement. Such a result would violate the longstanding\nprinciple that, when a patented item is \u201conce lawfully\nmade and sold, there is no restriction on [its] use to be\nimplied for the benefit of the patentee.\u201d Adams, 17 Wall.,\nat 457. We therefore reject LGE\u2019s argument that method\nclaims, as a category, are never exhaustible.\n                              B\n   We next consider the extent to which a product must\nembody a patent in order to trigger exhaustion. Quanta\nargues that, although sales of an incomplete article do not\nnecessarily exhaust the patent in that article, the sale of\nthe microprocessors and chipsets exhausted LGE\u2019s patents\nin the same way the sale of the lens blanks exhausted the\npatents in Univis. Just as the lens blanks in Univis did\nnot fully practice the patents at issue because they had\nnot been ground into finished lenses, Quanta observes, the\nIntel Products cannot practice the LGE Patents\u2014or in-\ndeed, function at all\u2014until they are combined with mem-\nory and buses in a computer system. If, as in Univis,\npatent rights are exhausted by the sale of the incomplete\nitem, then LGE has no postsale right to require that the\npatents be practiced using only Intel parts. Quanta also\nargues that exhaustion doctrine will be a dead letter\nunless it is triggered by the sale of components that essen-\ntially, even if not completely, embody an invention. Oth-\nerwise, patent holders could authorize the sale of com-\nputers that are complete with the exception of one minor\nstep\u2014say, inserting the microprocessor into a socket\u2014and\nextend their rights through each downstream purchaser\nall the way to the end user.\n   LGE, for its part, argues that Univis is inapplicable here\nfor three reasons. First, it maintains that Univis should\nbe limited to products that contain all the physical aspects\nneeded to practice the patent. On that theory, the Intel\nProducts cannot embody the patents because additional\n12   QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nphysical components are required before the patents can\nbe practiced. Second, LGE asserts that in Univis there\nwas no \u201cpatentable distinction\u201d between the lens blanks\nand the patented finished lenses since they were both\nsubject to the same patent. Brief for Respondent 14 (citing\nUnivis, supra, at 248\u2013252). In contrast, it describes the\nIntel Products as \u201cindependent and distinct products\u201d from\nthe systems using the LGE Patents and subject to \u201cinde-\npendent patents.\u201d Brief for Respondent 13. Finally, LGE\nargues that Univis does not apply because the Intel Prod-\nucts are analogous to individual elements of a combination\npatent, and allowing sale of those components to exhaust\nthe patent would impermissibly \u201cascrib[e] to one element\nof the patented combination the status of the patented\ninvention in itself.\u201d Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Re-\nplacement Co., 365 U. S. 336, 344\u2013345 (1961).\n   We agree with Quanta that Univis governs this case. As\nthe Court there explained, exhaustion was triggered by\nthe sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable\nand intended use was to practice the patent and because\nthey \u201cembodie[d] essential features of [the] patented in-\nvention.\u201d 316 U. S., at 249\u2013251. Each of those attributes\nis shared by the microprocessors and chipsets Intel sold to\nQuanta under the License Agreement.\n   First, Univis held that \u201cthe authorized sale of an article\nwhich is capable of use only in practicing the patent is a\nrelinquishment of the patent monopoly with respect to the\narticle sold.\u201d Id., at 249. The lens blanks in Univis met\nthis standard because they were \u201cwithout utility until\n[they were] ground and polished as the finished lens of the\npatent.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, \u201cthe only object of the sale\n[was] to enable the [finishing retailer] to grind and polish\nit for use as a lens by the prospective wearer.\u201d Ibid. Here,\nLGE has suggested no reasonable use for the Intel Prod-\nucts other than incorporating them into computer systems\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthat practice the LGE Patents.6 Nor can we can discern\none: A microprocessor or chipset cannot function until it is\nconnected to buses and memory. And here, as in Univis,\nthe only apparent object of Intel\u2019s sales to Quanta was to\npermit Quanta to incorporate the Intel Products into\ncomputers that would practice the patents.\n  Second, the lens blanks in Univis \u201cembodie[d] essential\nfeatures of [the] patented invention.\u201d Id., at 250\u2013251. The\nessential, or inventive, feature of the Univis lens patents\nwas the fusing together of different lens segments to cre-\nate bi- and tri-focal lenses. The finishing process per-\nformed by the finishing and prescription retailers after the\nfusing was not unique. As the United States explained:\n     \u201cThe finishing licensees finish Univis lens blanks in\n     precisely the same manner as they finish all other bi-\n     focal lens blanks. Indeed, appellees have never con-\n     tended that their licensing system is supported by\n     patents covering methods or processes relating to the\n     finishing of lens blanks. Consequently, it appears\n     that appellees perform all of the operations which con-\n     tribute any claimed element of novelty to Univis\n     lenses.\u201d Brief for United States in United States v.\n     Univis Lens Co., O. T. 1941, No. 855 et al., p. 10 (foot-\n     note and citations omitted).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 LGE suggests that the Intel Products would not infringe its patents\n\nif they were sold overseas, used as replacement parts, or engineered so\nthat use with non-Intel Products would disable their patented features.\nBrief for Respondent 21\u201322, n. 10. But Univis teaches that the ques-\ntion is whether the product is \u201ccapable of use only in practicing the\npatent,\u201d not whether those uses are infringing. 316 U. S., at 249\n(emphasis added). Whether outside the country or functioning as\nreplacement parts, the Intel Products would still be practicing the\npatent, even if not infringing it. And since the features partially\npracticing the patent are what must have an alternative use, suggest-\ning that they be disabled is no solution. The disabled features would\nhave no real use.\n14   QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nWhile the Court assumed that the finishing process was\ncovered by the patents, Univis, supra, at 248\u2013249, and the\nDistrict Court found that it was necessary to make a\nworking lens, United States v. Univis Lens Co., 41\nF. Supp. 258, 262\u2013263 (SDNY 1941), the grinding process\nwas not central to the patents. That standard process was\nnot included in detail in any of the patents and was not\nreferred to at all in two of the patents. Those that did\nmention the finishing process treated it as incidental to\nthe invention, noting, for example, that \u201c[t]he blank is\nthen ground in the usual manner,\u201d U. S. Patent No.\n1,876,497, p. 2, or simply that the blank is \u201cthen ground\nand polished,\u201d U. S. Patent No. 1,632,208, p. 1, Tr. of\nRecord in United States v. Univis Lens Co., O. T. 1941,\nNo. 855 et al., pp. 516, 498.\n   Like the Univis lens blanks, the Intel Products consti-\ntute a material part of the patented invention and all but\ncompletely practice the patent. Here, as in Univis, the\nincomplete article substantially embodies the patent\nbecause the only step necessary to practice the patent is\nthe application of common processes or the addition of\nstandard parts. Everything inventive about each patent is\nembodied in the Intel Products. They control access to\nmain and cache memory, practicing the \u2019641 and \u2019379\npatents by checking cache memory against main memory\nand comparing read and write requests. They also control\npriority of bus access by various other computer compo-\nnents under the \u2019733 patent. Naturally, the Intel Products\ncannot carry out these functions unless they are attached\nto memory and buses, but those additions are standard\ncomponents in the system, providing the material that\nenables the microprocessors and chipsets to function. The\nIntel Products were specifically designed to function only\nwhen memory or buses are attached; Quanta was not\nrequired to make any creative or inventive decision when\nit added those parts. Indeed, Quanta had no alternative\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut to follow Intel\u2019s specifications in incorporating the\nIntel Products into its computers because it did not know\ntheir internal structure, which Intel guards as a trade\nsecret. Brief for Petitioners 3. Intel all but practiced the\npatent itself by designing its products to practice the\npatents, lacking only the addition of standard parts.\n  We are unpersuaded by LGE\u2019s attempts to distinguish\nUnivis. First, there is no reason to distinguish the two\ncases on the ground that the articles in Univis required\nthe removal of material to practice the patent while the\nIntel Products require the addition of components to\npractice the patent. LGE characterizes the lens blanks\nand lenses as sharing a \u201cbasic nature\u201d by virtue of their\nphysical similarity, while the Intel Products embody only\nsome of the \u201cpatentably distinct elements and steps\u201d in-\nvolved in the LGE Patents. Brief for Respondent 26\u201327.\nBut we think that the nature of the final step, rather than\nwhether it consists of adding or deleting material, is the\nrelevant characteristic. In each case, the final step to\npractice the patent is common and noninventive: grinding\na lens to the customer\u2019s prescription, or connecting a\nmicroprocessor or chipset to buses or memory. The Intel\nProducts embody the essential features of the LGE Pat-\nents because they carry out all the inventive processes\nwhen combined, according to their design, with standard\ncomponents.\n  With regard to LGE\u2019s argument that exhaustion does\nnot apply across patents, we agree on the general princi-\nple: The sale of a device that practices patent A does not,\nby virtue of practicing patent A, exhaust patent B. But if\nthe device practices patent A while substantially embody-\ning patent B, its relationship to patent A does not prevent\nexhaustion of patent B. For example, if the Univis lens\nblanks had been composed of shatter-resistant glass under\npatent A, the blanks would nonetheless have substantially\nembodied, and therefore exhausted, patent B for the fin-\n16   QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nished lenses. This case is no different. While each Intel\nmicroprocessor and chipset practices thousands of individ-\nual patents, including some LGE patents not at issue in\nthis case, the exhaustion analysis is not altered by the fact\nthat more than one patent is practiced by the same prod-\nuct. The relevant consideration is whether the Intel Prod-\nucts that partially practice a patent\u2014by, for example,\nembodying its essential features\u2014exhaust that patent.\n   Finally, LGE\u2019s reliance on Aro is misplaced because that\ncase dealt only with the question whether replacement of\none part of a patented combination infringes the patent.\nFirst, the replacement question is not at issue here. Sec-\nond, and more importantly, Aro is not squarely applicable\nto the exhaustion of patents like the LGE Patents that do\nnot disclose a new combination of existing parts. Aro\ndescribed combination patents as \u201ccover[ing] only the\ntotality of the elements in the claim [so] that no element,\nseparately viewed, is within the grant.\u201d 365 U. S., at 344;\nsee also Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co.,\n320 U. S. 661, 667\u2013668 (1944) (noting that, in a combina-\ntion patent, \u201cthe combination is the invention and it is\ndistinct from any\u201d of its elements). Aro\u2019s warning that no\nelement can be viewed as central to or equivalent to the\ninvention is specific to the context in which the combina-\ntion itself is the only inventive aspect of the patent. In\nthis case, the inventive part of the patent is not the fact\nthat memory and buses are combined with a microproces-\nsor or chipset; rather, it is included in the design of the\nIntel Products themselves and the way these products\naccess the memory or bus.\n                           C\n  Having concluded that the Intel Products embodied the\npatents, we next consider whether their sale to Quanta\nexhausted LGE\u2019s patent rights. Exhaustion is triggered\nonly by a sale authorized by the patent holder. Univis,\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n316 U. S., at 249.\n   LGE argues that there was no authorized sale here\nbecause the License Agreement does not permit Intel to\nsell its products for use in combination with non-Intel\nproducts to practice the LGE Patents. It cites General\nTalking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co., 304 U. S. 175\n(1938), and General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western\nElec. Co., 305 U. S. 124 (1938), in which the manufacturer\nsold patented amplifiers for commercial use, thereby\nbreaching a license that limited the buyer to selling the\namplifiers for private and home use. The Court held that\nexhaustion did not apply because the manufacturer had no\nauthority to sell the amplifiers for commercial use, and the\nmanufacturer \u201ccould not convey to petitioner what both\nknew it was not authorized to sell.\u201d General Talking\nPictures, supra, at 181. LGE argues that the same princi-\nple applies here: Intel could not convey to Quanta what\nboth knew it was not authorized to sell, i.e., the right to\npractice the patents with non-Intel parts.\n   LGE overlooks important aspects of the structure of the\nIntel-LGE transaction. Nothing in the License Agreement\nrestricts Intel\u2019s right to sell its microprocessors and chip-\nsets to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-\nIntel parts. It broadly permits Intel to \u201c \u2018make, use, [or]\nsell\u2019 \u201d products free of LGE\u2019s patent claims. Brief for Peti-\ntioners 8 (quoting App. 154). To be sure, LGE did require\nIntel to give notice to its customers, including Quanta,\nthat LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its\npatents. But neither party contends that Intel breached\nthe agreement in that respect. Brief for Petitioners 9;\nBrief for Respondent 9. In any event, the provision requir-\ning notice to Quanta appeared only in the Master Agree-\nment, and LGE does not suggest that a breach of that\nagreement would constitute a breach of the License\nAgreement. Hence, Intel\u2019s authority to sell its products\nembodying the LGE Patents was not conditioned on the\n18    QUANTA COMPUTER, INC. v. LG ELECTRONICS, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nnotice or on Quanta\u2019s decision to abide by LGE\u2019s directions\nin that notice.\n   LGE points out that the License Agreement specifically\ndisclaimed any license to third parties to practice the\npatents by combining licensed products with other compo-\nnents. Brief for Petitioners 8. But the question whether\nthird parties received implied licenses is irrelevant be-\ncause Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents\nbased not on implied license but on exhaustion. And\nexhaustion turns only on Intel\u2019s own license to sell prod-\nucts practicing the LGE Patents.\n   Alternatively, LGE invokes the principle that patent\nexhaustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on \u201cmak-\ning\u201d an article. Brief for Respondent 43. But this is sim-\nply a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel\nProducts with other components adds more than standard\nfinishing to complete a patented article. As explained\nabove, making a product that substantially embodies a\npatent is, for exhaustion purposes, no different from mak-\ning the patented article itself. In other words, no further\n\u201cmaking\u201d results from the addition of standard parts\u2014\nhere, the buses and memory\u2014to a product that already\nsubstantially embodies the patent.\n   The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products\nthat practiced the LGE Patents. No conditions limited\nIntel\u2019s authority to sell products substantially embodying\nthe patents. Because Intel was authorized to sell its prod-\nucts to Quanta, the doctrine of patent exhaustion prevents\nLGE from further asserting its patent rights with respect\nto the patents substantially embodied by those products.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We note that the authorized nature of the sale to Quanta does not\n\nnecessarily limit LGE\u2019s other contract rights. LGE\u2019s complaint does not\ninclude a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on\nwhether contract damages might be available even though exhaustion\noperates to eliminate patent damages. See Keeler v. Standard Folding\nBed Co., 157 U. S. 659, 666 (1895) (\u201cWhether a patentee may protect\n                    Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008) \n                 19\n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             IV \n\n  The authorized sale of an article that substantially\nembodies a patent exhausts the patent holder\u2019s rights and\nprevents the patent holder from invoking patent law to\ncontrol postsale use of the article. Here, LGE licensed\nIntel to practice any of its patents and to sell products\npracticing those patents. Intel\u2019s microprocessors and\nchipsets substantially embodied the LGE Patents because\nthey had no reasonable noninfringing use and included all\nthe inventive aspects of the patented methods. Nothing in\nthe License Agreement limited Intel\u2019s ability to sell its\nproducts practicing the LGE Patents. Intel\u2019s authorized\nsale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of\nthe patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer\nassert its patent rights against Quanta. Accordingly, the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n                                                       It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhimself and his assignees by special contracts brought home to the\npurchasers is not a question before us, and upon which we express no\nopinion. It is, however, obvious that such a question would arise as a\nquestion of contract, and not as one under the inherent meaning and\neffect of the patent laws\u201d).\n", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b>128 S.Ct. 2109 (2008)</b></center>\n<center><h1>QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., et al., Petitioners,<br>\nv.<br>\nLG ELECTRONICS, INC.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 06-937.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued January 16, 2008.</center>\n<center>Decided June 9, 2008.</center>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2112</span> Maureen E.

In this case, we decide whether patent exhaustion applies to the sale of components of a patented system that must be combined with additional components in order to practice the patented methods. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the doctrine does not apply to method patents at all and, in the alternative, that it does not apply here because the sales were not authorized by the license agreement. We disagree on both scores. Because the exhaustion doctrine applies to method patents, and because the license authorizes the sale of components that substantially embody the patents in suit, the sale exhausted the patents.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Respondent LG Electronics, Inc. (LGE), purchased a portfolio of computer technology patents in 1999, including the three patents at issue here: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,939,641 ('641); 5,379,379 ('379); and 5,077,733 ('733) (collectively LGE Patents). The main functions of a computer system are carried out on a microprocessor, or central processing unit, which interprets program instructions, processes data, and controls other devices in the system. A set of wires, or bus, connects the microprocessor to a chipset, which transfers data between the microprocessor and other devices, including the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive, memory, and disk drives.</p>\n<p>The data processed by the computer are stored principally in random access memory, also called main memory. Webster's New World Dictionary of Computer Terms 334, 451 (8th ed.2000). Frequently accessed data are generally stored in cache memory, which permits faster access than main memory and is often located on the microprocessor itself. <i>Id.,</i> at 84. When copies of data are stored in both the cache and main memory, problems may arise when one copy is changed but the other still contains the original \"stale\" version of the data. J. Handy, Cache Memory Book 124 (2d ed.1993). The '641 patent addresses this problem. It discloses a system for ensuring that the most current data are retrieved from main memory by monitoring data requests and updating main memory from the cache when stale data are requested. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794948\"><a href=\"/opinion/794948/lg-electronics-inc-v-bizcom-electronics-inc-compal/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1377 (C.A.Fed.2006).</p>\n<p>The '379 patent relates to the coordination of requests to read from, and write to, main memory. <i>Id.,</i> at 1378. Processing these requests in chronological order can slow down a system because read requests are faster to execute than write requests. Processing all read requests first ensures speedy access, but may result in the retrieval of outdated data if a read request for a certain piece of data is processed before an outstanding write request for the same data. The '379 patent discloses an efficient method of organizing read and write requests while maintaining accuracy by allowing the computer to execute only read requests until it needs data for which there is an outstanding write request. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.,</i> No. C 01-02187 CW et al., Order Construing Disputed Terms and Phrases, p. 42 (ND Cal., Aug. 20, 2002). Upon receiving such a read request, the computer executes pending write requests first and only then returns to the read requests so that the most up-to-date data are retrieved. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The '733 patent addresses the problem of managing the data traffic on a bus connecting two computer components, so <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2114</span> that no one device monopolizes the bus. It allows multiple devices to share the bus, giving heavy users greater access. This patent describes methods that establish a rotating priority system under which each device alternately has priority access to the bus for a preset number of cycles and heavier users can maintain priority for more cycles without \"hogging\" the device indefinitely. <i>Id.,</i> at 37-38.</p>\n<p>LGE licensed a patent portfolio, including the LGE Patents, to Intel Corporation (Intel). The cross-licensing agreement (License Agreement) permits Intel to manufacture and sell microprocessors and chipsets that use the LGE Patents (the Intel Products). The License Agreement authorizes Intel to \"`make, use, sell (directly or indirectly), offer to sell, import or otherwise dispose of'\" its own products practicing the LGE Patents. Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 154).<sup>[1]</sup> Notwithstanding this broad language, the License Agreement contains some limitations. Relevant here, it stipulates that no license</p>\n<blockquote>\"`is granted by either party hereto . . . to any third party for the combination by a third party of Licensed Products of either party with items, components, or the like acquired . . . from sources other than a party hereto, or for the use, import, offer for sale or sale of such combination.'\" Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 164).</blockquote>\n<p>The License Agreement purports not to alter the usual rules of patent exhaustion, however, providing that, \"`[n]otwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.'\" Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 164).</p>\n<p>In a separate agreement (Master Agreement), Intel agreed to give written notice to its own customers informing them that, while it had obtained a broad license \"`ensur[ing] that any Intel product that you purchase is licensed by LGE and thus does not infringe any patent held by LGE,'\" the license \"`does not extend, expressly or by implication, to any product that you make by combining an Intel product with any non-Intel product.'\" Brief for Respondent 9 (emphasis deleted) (quoting App. 198). The Master Agreement also provides that \"`a breach of this Agreement shall have no effect on and shall not be grounds for termination of the Patent License.'\" Brief for Petitioners 9 (quoting App. 176).</p>\n<p>Petitioners, including Quanta Computer (collectively Quanta), are a group of computer manufacturers. Quanta purchased microprocessors and chipsets from Intel and received the notice required by the Master Agreement. Nonetheless, Quanta manufactured computers using Intel parts in combination with non-Intel memory and buses in ways that practice the LGE Patents. Quanta does not modify the Intel components and follows Intel's specifications to incorporate the parts into its own systems.</p>\n<p>LGE filed a complaint against Quanta, asserting that the combination of the Intel Products with non-Intel memory and buses infringed the LGE Patents. The District Court granted summary judgment to Quanta, holding that, for purposes of the patent exhaustion doctrine, the license LGE granted to Intel resulted in forfeiture of any potential infringement actions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2115</span> against legitimate purchasers of the Intel Products. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.,</i> 65 USPQ 2d 1589, 1593, 1600 (N.D.Cal.2002). The court found that, although the Intel Products do not fully practice any of the patents at issue, they have no reasonable noninfringing use and therefore their authorized sale exhausted patent rights in the completed computers under <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103675\"><a href=\"/opinion/103675/united-states-v-univis-lens-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 86 L.Ed. 1408 (1942). <i>Asustek, supra,</i> at 1598-1600. In a subsequent order limiting its summary judgment ruling, the court held that patent exhaustion applies only to apparatus or composition-of-matter claims that describe a physical object, and does not apply to process, or method, claims that describe operations to make or use a product. <i>LG Electronics, Inc. v. Asustek Computer, Inc.,</i> 248 F.Supp.2d 912, 918 (N.D.Cal.2003). Because each of the LGE Patents includes method claims, exhaustion did not apply.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. It agreed that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not apply to method claims. In the alternative, it concluded that exhaustion did not apply because LGE did not license Intel to sell the Intel Products to Quanta for use in combination with non-Intel products. 453 F.3d, at 1370.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 551 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 28, 168 L.Ed.2d 805 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item. This Court first applied the doctrine in 19th-century cases addressing patent extensions on the Woodworth planing machine. Purchasers of licenses to sell and use the machine for the duration of the original patent term sought to continue using the licenses through the extended term. The Court held that the extension of the patent term did not affect the rights already secured by purchasers who bought the item for use \"in the ordinary pursuits of life.\" <i>Bloomer v.

A.B. Dick Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"97584\"><a href=\"/opinion/97584/henry-v-ab-dick-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 32 S.Ct. 364, 56 L.Ed. 645 (1912),<sup>[2]</sup> that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2116</span> decision was short lived. In 1913, the Court refused to apply <i>A.B. Dick</i> to uphold price-fixing provisions in a patent license. See <i>Bauer &amp; Cie v.

Shortly thereafter, in <i>Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98917\"><a href=\"/opinion/98917/motion-picture-co-v-universal-film-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 518, 37 S.Ct. 416, 61 L.Ed. 871 (1917), the Court explicitly overruled <i>A.B. Dick.</i> In that case, a patent holder attempted to limit purchasers' use of its film projectors to show only film made under a patent held by the same company. The Court noted the \"increasing frequency\" with which patent holders were using <i>A.B. Dick</i>-style licenses to limit the use of their products and thereby using the patents to secure market control of related, unpatented items. 243 U.S., at 509, 516-517, 37 S.Ct. 416. Observing that \"the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents but is `to promote the progress of science and useful arts,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 511, 37 S.Ct. 416 (quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8), the Court held that \"the scope of the grant which may be made to an inventor in a patent, pursuant to the [patent] statute, must be limited to the invention described in the claims of his patent.\" 243 U.S., at 511, 37 S.Ct. 416. Accordingly, it reiterated the rule that \"the right to vend is exhausted by a single, unconditional sale, the article sold being thereby carried outside the monopoly of the patent law and rendered free of every restriction which the vendor may attempt to put upon it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 516, 37 S.Ct. 416.</p>\n<p>This Court most recently discussed patent exhaustion in <i>Univis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103675\"><a href=\"/opinion/103675/united-states-v-univis-lens-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">241</span></a></span>, 62 S.Ct. 1088, 86 L.Ed. 1408, on which the District Court relied. Univis Lens Company, the holder of patents on eyeglass lenses, licensed a purchaser to manufacture lens blanks<sup>[3]</sup> by fusing together different lens segments to create bi- and tri-focal lenses and to sell them to other Univis licensees at agreed-upon rates. Wholesalers were licensed to grind the blanks into the patented finished lenses, which they would then sell to Univis-licensed prescription retailers for resale at a fixed rate. Finishing retailers, after grinding the blanks into patented lenses, would sell the finished lenses to consumers at the same fixed rate. The United States sued Univis under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, 15, alleging unlawful restraints on trade. Univis asserted its patent monopoly rights as a defense to the antitrust suit. The Court granted certiorari to determine whether Univis' patent monopoly survived the sale of the lens blanks by the licensed manufacturer and therefore shielded Univis' pricing scheme from the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p>The Court assumed that the Univis patents containing claims for finished lenses were practiced in part by the wholesalers and finishing retailers who ground the blanks into lenses, and held that the sale of the lens blanks exhausted the patents on the finished lenses. <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S., at 248-249, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The Court explained that the lens blanks \"embodi[ed] essential features of the patented device and [were] without utility until . . . ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote>\"where one has sold an uncompleted article which, because it embodies essential features of his patented invention, is within the protection of his patent, and has destined the article to be finished by the purchaser in conformity to the patent, he has sold his invention so far as it <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2117</span> is or may be embodied in that particular article.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 250-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, the Court concluded that the traditional bar on patent restrictions following the sale of an item applies when the item sufficiently embodies the patent\u0097 even if it does not completely practice the patent\u0097such that its only and intended use is to be finished under the terms of the patent.</p>\n<p>With this history of the patent exhaustion doctrine in mind, we turn to the parties' arguments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>LGE argues that the exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable here because it does not apply to method claims, which are contained in each of the LGE Patents. LGE reasons that, because method patents are linked not to a tangible article but to a process, they can never be exhausted through a sale. Rather, practicing the patent\u0097which occurs upon each use of an article embodying a method patent\u0097is permissible only to the extent rights are transferred in an assignment contract. Quanta, in turn, argues that there is no reason to preclude exhaustion of method claims, and points out that both this Court and the Federal Circuit have applied exhaustion to method claims. It argues that any other rule would allow patent holders to avoid exhaustion entirely by inserting method claims in their patent specifications.</p>\n<p>Quanta has the better of this argument. Nothing in this Court's approach to patent exhaustion supports LGE's argument that method patents cannot be exhausted. It is true that a patented method may not be sold in the same way as an article or device, but methods nonetheless may be \"embodied\" in a product, the sale of which exhausts patent rights. Our precedents do not differentiate transactions involving embodiments of patented methods or processes from those involving patented apparatuses or materials. To the contrary, this Court has repeatedly held that method patents were exhausted by the sale of an item that embodied the method. In <i>Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103321\"><a href=\"/opinion/103321/ethyl-gasoline-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 446, 457, 60 S.Ct. 618, 84 L.Ed. 852 (1940), for example, the Court held that the sale of a motor fuel produced under one patent also exhausted the patent for a method of using the fuel in combustion motors.<sup>[4]</sup> Similarly, as previously described, <i>Univis</i> held that the sale of optical lens blanks that partially practiced a patent exhausted the method patents that were not completely practiced until the blanks were ground into lenses. 316 U.S., at 248-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</p>\n<p>These cases rest on solid footing. Eliminating exhaustion for method patents would seriously undermine the exhaustion doctrine. Patentees seeking to avoid patent exhaustion could simply draft their patent claims to describe a method rather than an apparatus.<sup>[5]</sup> Apparatus and method <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2118</span> claims \"may approach each other so nearly that it will be difficult to distinguish the process from the function of the apparatus.\" <i>United States ex rel. Steinmetz v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96011\"><a href=\"/opinion/96011/united-states-ex-rel-steinmetz-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 559, 24 S.Ct. 416, 48 L.Ed. 555 (1904). By characterizing their claims as method instead of apparatus claims, or including a method claim for the machine's patented method of performing its task, a patent drafter could shield practically any patented item from exhaustion.</p>\n<p>This case illustrates the danger of allowing such an end-run around exhaustion. On LGE's theory, although Intel is authorized to sell a completed computer system that practices the LGE Patents, any downstream purchasers of the system could nonetheless be liable for patent infringement. Such a result would violate the longstanding principle that, when a patented item is \"once lawfully made and sold, there is no restriction on [its] <i>use</i> to be implied for the benefit of the patentee.\" <i>Adams,</i> 17 Wall., at 457, 21 L.Ed. 700. We therefore reject LGE's argument that method claims, as a category, are never exhaustible.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>We next consider the extent to which a product must embody a patent in order to trigger exhaustion. Quanta argues that, although sales of an incomplete article do not necessarily exhaust the patent in that article, the sale of the microprocessors and chipsets exhausted LGE's patents in the same way the sale of the lens blanks exhausted the patents in <i>Univis.</i> Just as the lens blanks in <i>Univis</i> did not fully practice the patents at issue because they had not been ground into finished lenses, Quanta observes, the Intel Products cannot practice the LGE Patents\u0097or indeed, function at all\u0097until they are combined with memory and buses in a computer system. If, as in <i>Univis,</i> patent rights are exhausted by the sale of the incomplete item, then LGE has no postsale right to require that the patents be practiced using only Intel parts. Quanta also argues that exhaustion doctrine will be a dead letter unless it is triggered by the sale of components that essentially, even if not completely, embody an invention. Otherwise, patent holders could authorize the sale of computers that are complete with the exception of one minor step\u0097say, inserting the microprocessor into a socket\u0097 and extend their rights through each downstream purchaser all the way to the end user.</p>\n<p>LGE, for its part, argues that <i>Univis</i> is inapplicable here for three reasons. First, it maintains that <i>Univis</i> should be limited to products that contain all the physical aspects needed to practice the patent. On that theory, the Intel Products cannot embody the patents because additional physical components are required before the patents can be practiced. Second, LGE asserts that in <i>Univis</i> there was no \"patentable distinction\" between the lens blanks and the patented finished lenses since they were both subject to the same patent. Brief for Respondent 14 (citing <i>Univis, supra,</i> at 248-252, 62 S.Ct. 1088). In contrast, it describes the Intel Products as \"independent and distinct products\" from the systems using the LGE Patents and subject to \"independent patents.\" Brief for Respondent 13. Finally, LGE argues that <i>Univis</i> does not apply because the Intel Products are analogous to individual elements of a combination patent, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2119</span> and allowing sale of those components to exhaust the patent would impermissibly \"ascrib[e] to one element of the patented combination the status of the patented invention in itself.\" <i>Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106179\"><a href=\"/opinion/106179/aro-mfg-co-v-convertible-top-replacement-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 344-345, 81 S.Ct. 599, 5 L.Ed.2d 592 (1961).</p>\n<p>We agree with Quanta that <i>Univis</i> governs this case. As the Court there explained, exhaustion was triggered by the sale of the lens blanks because their only reasonable and intended use was to practice the patent and because they \"embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention.\" 316 U.S., at 249-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088. Each of those attributes is shared by the microprocessors and chipsets Intel sold to Quanta under the License Agreement.</p>\n<p>First, <i>Univis</i> held that \"the authorized sale of an article which is capable of use only in practicing the patent is a relinquishment of the patent monopoly with respect to the article sold.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The lens blanks in <i>Univis</i> met this standard because they were \"without utility until [they were] ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Accordingly, \"the only object of the sale [was] to enable the [finishing retailer] to grind and polish it for use as a lens by the prospective wearer.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Here, LGE has suggested no reasonable use for the Intel Products other than incorporating them into computer systems that practice the LGE Patents.<sup>[6]</sup> Nor can we can discern one: A microprocessor or chipset cannot function until it is connected to buses and memory. And here, as in <i>Univis,</i> the only apparent object of Intel's sales to Quanta was to permit Quanta to incorporate the Intel Products into computers that would practice the patents.</p>\n<p>Second, the lens blanks in <i>Univis</i> \"embodie[d] essential features of [the] patented invention.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 250-251, 62 S.Ct. 1088. The essential, or inventive, feature of the Univis lens patents was the fusing together of different lens segments to create bi- and tri-focal lenses. The finishing process performed by the finishing and prescription retailers after the fusing was not unique. As the United States explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The finishing licensees finish Univis lens blanks in precisely the same manner as they finish all other bifocal lens blanks. Indeed, appellees have never contended that their licensing system is supported by patents covering methods or processes relating to the finishing of lens blanks. Consequently, it appears that appellees perform all of the operations which contribute any claimed element of novelty to Univis lenses.\" Brief for United States in <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> O.T.1941, No. 855 et al., p. 10 (footnote and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>While the Court assumed that the finishing process was covered by the patents, <i>Univis, supra,</i> at 248-249, 62 S.Ct. 1088, and the District Court found that it was necessary to make a working lens, <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> 41 F.Supp. 258, 262-263 (S.D.N.Y.1941), the grinding process <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2120</span> was not central to the patents. That standard process was not included in detail in any of the patents and was not referred to at all in two of the patents. Those that did mention the finishing process treated it as incidental to the invention, noting, for example, that \"[t]he blank is then ground in the usual manner,\" U.S. Patent No. 1,876,497, p. 2, or simply that the blank is \"then ground and polished,\" U.S. Patent No. 1,632,208, p. 1, Tr. of Record in <i>United States v. Univis Lens Co.,</i> O.T.1941, No. 855 et al., pp. 516, 498.</p>\n<p>Like the Univis lens blanks, the Intel Products constitute a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practice the patent. Here, as in <i>Univis,</i> the incomplete article substantially embodies the patent because the only step necessary to practice the patent is the application of common processes or the addition of standard parts. Everything inventive about each patent is embodied in the Intel Products. They control access to main and cache memory, practicing the '641 and '379 patents by checking cache memory against main memory and comparing read and write requests. They also control priority of bus access by various other computer components under the '733 patent. Naturally, the Intel Products cannot carry out these functions unless they are attached to memory and buses, but those additions are standard components in the system, providing the material that enables the microprocessors and chipsets to function. The Intel Products were specifically designed to function only when memory or buses are attached; Quanta was not required to make any creative or inventive decision when it added those parts. Indeed, Quanta had no alternative but to follow Intel's specifications in incorporating the Intel Products into its computers because it did not know their internal structure, which Intel guards as a trade secret. Brief for Petitioners 3. Intel all but practiced the patent itself by designing its products to practice the patents, lacking only the addition of standard parts.</p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded by LGE's attempts to distinguish <i>Univis.</i> First, there is no reason to distinguish the two cases on the ground that the articles in Univis required the <i>removal</i> of material to practice the patent while the Intel Products require the <i>addition</i> of components to practice the patent. LGE characterizes the lens blanks and lenses as sharing a \"basic nature\" by virtue of their physical similarity, while the Intel Products embody only some of the \"patentably distinct elements and steps\" involved in the LGE Patents. Brief for Respondent 26-27. But we think that the nature of the final step, rather than whether it consists of adding or deleting material, is the relevant characteristic. In each case, the final step to practice the patent is common and noninventive: grinding a lens to the customer's prescription, or connecting a microprocessor or chipset to buses or memory. The Intel Products embody the essential features of the LGE Patents because they carry out all the inventive processes when combined, according to their design, with standard components.</p>\n<p>With regard to LGE's argument that exhaustion does not apply across patents, we agree on the general principle: The sale of a device that practices patent A does not, by virtue of practicing patent A, exhaust patent B. But if the device practices patent A <i>while substantially embodying</i> patent B, its relationship to patent A does not prevent exhaustion of patent B. For example, if the Univis lens blanks had been composed of shatter-resistant glass under patent A, the blanks would nonetheless have substantially embodied, and therefore exhausted, patent B for the finished lenses. This case is no different. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2121</span> While each Intel microprocessor and chipset practices thousands of individual patents, including some LGE patents not at issue in this case, the exhaustion analysis is not altered by the fact that more than one patent is practiced by the same product. The relevant consideration is whether the Intel Products that partially practice a patent\u0097by, for example, embodying its essential features\u0097exhaust <i>that</i> patent.</p>\n<p>Finally, LGE's reliance on <i>Aro</i> is misplaced because that case dealt only with the question whether replacement of one part of a patented combination infringes the patent. First, the replacement question is not at issue here. Second, and more importantly, <i>Aro</i> is not squarely applicable to the exhaustion of patents like the LGE Patents that do not disclose a new combination of existing parts. <i>Aro</i> described combination patents as \"cover[ing] only the totality of the elements in the claim [so] that no element, separately viewed, is within the grant.\" 365 U.S., at 344, 81 S.Ct. 599; see also <i>Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103916\"><a href=\"/opinion/103916/mercoid-corp-v-mid-continent-investment-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 667-668, 64 S.Ct. 268, 88 L.Ed. 376 (1944) (noting that, in a combination patent, \"the combination is the invention and it is distinct from any\" of its elements). <i>Aro's</i> warning that no element can be viewed as central to or equivalent to the invention is specific to the context in which the combination itself is the only inventive aspect of the patent. In this case, the inventive part of the patent is not the fact that memory and buses are combined with a microprocessor or chipset; rather, it is included in the design of the Intel Products themselves and the way these products access the memory or bus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Having concluded that the Intel Products embodied the patents, we next consider whether their sale to Quanta exhausted LGE's patent rights. Exhaustion is triggered only by a sale authorized by the patent holder. <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S., at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</p>\n<p>LGE argues that there was no authorized sale here because the License Agreement does not permit Intel to sell its products for use in combination with non-Intel products to practice the LGE Patents. It cites <i>General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103020\"><a href=\"/opinion/103020/general-pictures-co-v-electric-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 58 S.Ct. 849, 82 L.Ed. 1273 (1938), and <i>General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span>, 59 S.Ct. 116, 83 L.Ed. 81 (1938), in which the manufacturer sold patented amplifiers for commercial use, thereby breaching a license that limited the buyer to selling the amplifiers for private and home use. The Court held that exhaustion did not apply because the manufacturer had no authority to sell the amplifiers for commercial use, and the manufacturer \"could not convey to petitioner what both knew it was not authorized to sell.\" <i>General Talking Pictures, supra,</i> at 181, 58 S.Ct. 849. LGE argues that the same principle applies here: Intel could not convey to Quanta what both knew it was not authorized to sell, <i>i.e.,</i> the right to practice the patents with non-Intel parts.</p>\n<p>LGE overlooks important aspects of the structure of the Intel-LGE transaction. Nothing in the License Agreement restricts Intel's right to sell its microprocessors and chipsets to purchasers who intend to combine them with non-Intel parts. It broadly permits Intel to \"`make, use, [or] sell'\" products free of LGE's patent claims. Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting App. 154). To be sure, LGE did require Intel to give notice to its customers, including Quanta, that LGE had not licensed those customers to practice its patents. But neither party contends that Intel breached the agreement in that respect. Brief for Petitioners 9; Brief for Respondent 9. In any event, the provision requiring <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2122</span> notice to Quanta appeared only in the Master Agreement, and LGE does not suggest that a breach of that agreement would constitute a breach of the License Agreement. Hence, Intel's authority to sell its products embodying the LGE Patents was not conditioned on the notice or on Quanta's decision to abide by LGE's directions in that notice.</p>\n<p>LGE points out that the License Agreement specifically disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents by combining licensed products with other components. Brief for Petitioners 8. But the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because Quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion. And exhaustion turns only on Intel's own license to sell products practicing the LGE Patents.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, LGE invokes the principle that patent exhaustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on \"making\" an article. Brief for Respondent 43. But this is simply a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel Products with other components adds more than standard finishing to complete a patented article. As explained above, making a product that substantially embodies a patent is, for exhaustion purposes, no different from making the patented article itself. In other words, no further \"making\" results from the addition of standard parts\u0097here, the buses and memory\u0097to a product that already substantially embodies the patent.</p>\n<p>The License Agreement authorized Intel to sell products that practiced the LGE Patents. No conditions limited Intel's authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents. Because Intel was authorized to sell its products to Quanta, the doctrine of patent exhaustion prevents LGE from further asserting its patent rights with respect to the patents substantially embodied by those products.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The authorized sale of an article that substantially embodies a patent exhausts the patent holder's rights and prevents the patent holder from invoking patent law to control postsale use of the article. Here, LGE licensed Intel to practice any of its patents and to sell products practicing those patents. Intel's microprocessors and chipsets substantially embodied the LGE Patents because they had no reasonable noninfringing use and included all the inventive aspects of the patented methods. Nothing in the License Agreement limited Intel's ability to sell its products practicing the LGE Patents. Intel's authorized sale to Quanta thus took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly, and as a result, LGE can no longer assert its patent rights against Quanta. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  App. 145-198 is sealed; where material contained therein also appears in the parties' unsealed briefs, citations are to the latter.</p>\n<p>[2]  The A.B. Dick Company sold mimeograph machines with an attached license stipulating that the machine could be used only with ink, paper, and other supplies made by the A.B. Dick Company. The Court rejected the notion that a patent holder \"can only keep the article within the control of the patent by retaining the title,\" <i>A.B. Dick,</i> 224 U.S., at 18, 32 S.Ct. 364, and held that \"any . . . reasonable stipulation, not inherently violative of some substantive law\" was \"valid and enforceable,\" <i>id.,</i> at 31, 32 S.Ct. 364. The only requirement, the Court held, was that \"the purchaser must have notice that he buys with only a qualified right of use,\" so that a sale made without conditions resulted in \"an unconditional title to the machine, with no limitations upon the use.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 26, 32 S.Ct. 364.</p>\n<p>[3]  Lens blanks are \"rough opaque pieces of glass of suitable size, design and composition for use, when ground and polished, as multi-focal lenses in eyeglasses.\" <i>Univis,</i> 316 U.S., at 244, 62 S.Ct. 1088.</p>\n<p>[4]  The patentee held patents for (1) a fluid additive increasing gasoline efficiency, (2) motor fuel produced by mixing gasoline with the patented fluid, and (3) a method of using fuel containing the patented fluid in combustion motors. <i>Ethyl Gasoline Corp.,</i> 309 U.S., at 446, 60 S.Ct. 618. The patentee sold only the fluid, but attempted to control sales of the treated fuel. <i>Id.,</i> at 459, 60 S.Ct. 618. The Court held that the sale of the fluid to refiners relinquished the patentee's exclusive rights to sell the treated fuel. <i>Id.,</i> at 457, 60 S.Ct. 618.</p>\n<p>[5]  One commentator recommends this strategy as a way to draft patent claims that \"will survive numerous transactions regarding the patented good, allowing the force of the patent to intrude deeply into the stream of commerce.\" Thomas, Of Text, Technique, and the Tangible: Drafting Patent Claims Around Patent Rules, 17 J. Marshall J. Computer &amp; Info. L. 219, 252 (1998); see also <i>id.,</i> at 225-226 (advocating the conversion of apparatus claims into method claims and noting that \"[e]ven the most novice claims drafter would encounter scant difficulty in converting a patent claim from artifact to technique and back again\").</p>\n<p>[6]  LGE suggests that the Intel Products would not infringe its patents if they were sold overseas, used as replacement parts, or engineered so that use with non-Intel Products would disable their patented features. Brief for Respondent 21-22, n. 10. But <i>Univis</i> teaches that the question is whether the product is \"capable of use only in <i>practicing</i> the patent,\" not whether those uses are infringing. 316 U.S., at 249, 62 S.Ct. 1088 (emphasis added). Whether outside the country or functioning as replacement parts, the Intel Products would still be <i>practicing</i> the patent, even if not infringing it. And since the features partially practicing the patent are what must have an alternative use, suggesting that they be disabled is no solution. The disabled features would have no real <i>use.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  We note that the authorized nature of the sale to Quanta does not necessarily limit LGE's other contract rights. LGE's complaint does not include a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on whether contract damages might be available even though exhaustion operates to eliminate patent damages.
