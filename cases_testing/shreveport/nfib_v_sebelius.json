SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF \n\n        HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 11\u2013393.      Argued March 26, 27, 28, 2012\u2014Decided June 28, 2012*\nIn 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\n  Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health\n  insurance and decrease the cost of health care. One key provision is\n  the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain\n  \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage. 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A.\n  For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health\n  insurance through an employer or government program, the means of\n  satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private\n  company. Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the\n  mandate must make a \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d to the Fed-\n  eral Government. \u00a75000A(b)(1). The Act provides that this \u201cpenalty\u201d\n  will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual\u2019s tax-\n  es, and \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\u201d as tax\n  penalties. \u00a7\u00a75000A(c), (g)(1).\n    Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion. The\n  current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist\n  pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and\n  the disabled in obtaining medical care. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(a). The\n  Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and\n  increases the number of individuals the States must cover. For ex-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u2013398, Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices et al. v. Florida et al., and No. 11\u2013400, Florida et al. v. Department\nof Health and Human Services et al., also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    ample, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage\n    by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal pov-\n    erty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only\n    if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults\n    at all. \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The Act increases federal funding to\n    cover the States\u2019 costs in expanding Medicaid coverage. \u00a71396d(y)(1).\n    But if a State does not comply with the Act\u2019s new coverage require-\n    ments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those require-\n    ments, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. \u00a71396c.\n       Twenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federa-\n    tion of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court,\n    challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the\n    Medicaid expansion. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\n    upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s\n    spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to en-\n    act the individual mandate. Finding the mandate severable from the\n    Act\u2019s other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act in-\n    tact.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n648 F. 3d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n    1. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with\n  respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not\n  bar this suit.\n    The Anti-Injunction Act provides that \u201cno suit for the purpose of\n  restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be main-\n  tained in any court by any person,\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77421(a), so that those\n  subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund. The pre-\n  sent challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsi-\n  bility payment from those who do not comply with the individual\n  mandate. But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as\n  a \u201ctax\u201d for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. The Affordable Care\n  Act describes the payment as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d not a \u201ctax.\u201d That label\n  cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Con-\n  stitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction\n  Act. The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit. Pp. 11\u2013\n  15.\n    2. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III\u2013A that the indi-\n  vidual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the\n  Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Pp. 16\u201330.\n       (a) The Constitution grants Congress the power to \u201cregulate\n  Commerce.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power to regulate\n  commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be reg-\n  ulated. This Court\u2019s precedent reflects this understanding: As ex-\n  pansive as this Court\u2019s cases construing the scope of the commerce\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npower have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching \u201cac-\ntivity.\u201d E.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 560. The individ-\nual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activi-\nty. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by\npurchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects\ninterstate commerce.\n   Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate\nindividuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a\nnew and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Con-\ngress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.\nUpholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause\nwould give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not\ndo. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and\ndoing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce,\nnot to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the prin-\nciple that the Federal Government is a government of limited and\nenumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sus-\ntained under Congress\u2019s power to \u201cregulate Commerce.\u201d Pp. 16\u201327.\n      (b) Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Nec-\nessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care\nAct\u2019s other reforms. Each of this Court\u2019s prior cases upholding laws\nunder that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and\nin service to, a granted power. E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560\nU. S. ___. The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with\nthe extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the ex-\nercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope\nthose who would otherwise be outside of it. Even if the individual\nmandate is \u201cnecessary\u201d to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s other reforms,\nsuch an expansion of federal power is not a \u201cproper\u201d means for mak-\ning those reforms effective. Pp. 27\u201330.\n   3. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III\u2013B that the individ-\nual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do\nnot have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.\n   The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that\nit commands individuals to purchase insurance. But, for the reasons\nexplained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.\nIt is therefore necessary to turn to the Government\u2019s alternative ar-\ngument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress\u2019s power\nto \u201clay and collect Taxes.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. In pressing its taxing\npower argument, the Government asks the Court to view the man-\ndate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product. Be-\ncause \u201cevery reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to\nsave a statute from unconstitutionality,\u201d Hooper v. California, 155\nU. S. 648, 657, the question is whether it is \u201cfairly possible\u201d to inter-\n4            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    pret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 285\n    U. S. 22, 62. Pp. 31\u201332.\n       4. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with\n    respect to Part III\u2013C, concluding that the individual mandate may be\n    upheld as within Congress\u2019s power under the Taxing Clause. Pp. 33\u2013\n    44.\n          (a) The Affordable Care Act describes the \u201c[s]hared responsibility\n    payment\u201d as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d not a \u201ctax.\u201d That label is fatal to the appli-\n    cation of the Anti-Injunction Act. It does not, however, control\n    whether an exaction is within Congress\u2019s power to tax. In answering\n    that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach,\n    \u201c[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its sub-\n    stance and application.\u201d United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287,\n    294. Pp. 33\u201335.\n          (b) Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility\n    payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax. The\n    payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health\n    insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penal-\n    ties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by\n    the IRS through the normal means of taxation. Cf. Bailey v. Drexel\n    Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20, 36\u201337. None of this is to say that pay-\n    ment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance. But\n    the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is un-\n    lawful. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches\n    negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond\n    requiring a payment to the IRS. And Congress\u2019s choice of language\u2014\n    stating that individuals \u201cshall\u201d obtain insurance or pay a \u201cpenalty\u201d\u2014\n    does not require reading \u00a75000A as punishing unlawful conduct. It\n    may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insur-\n    ance. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 169\u2013174.\n    Pp. 35\u201340.\n          (c) Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a\n    tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides:\n    \u201cNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion\n    to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\u201d\n    Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 4. A tax on going without health insurance is not like a\n    capitation or other direct tax under this Court\u2019s precedents. It there-\n    fore need not be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to\n    its population. Pp. 40\u201341.\n       5. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, joined by JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE\n    KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that the Medicaid expansion violates\n    the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing\n    Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.\n    Pp. 45\u201358.\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (a) The Spending Clause grants Congress the power \u201cto pay the\nDebts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. Congress may use this power to establish cooperative\nstate-federal Spending Clause programs. The legitimacy of Spending\nClause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily\nand knowingly accepts the terms of such programs. Pennhurst State\nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. \u201c[T]he Constitu-\ntion simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States\nto regulate.\u201d New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 178. When\nCongress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressur-\ning the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation\nruns counter to this Nation\u2019s system of federalism. Cf. South Dakota\nv. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211. Pp. 45\u201351.\n      (b) Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices the authority to penalize States that choose not to participate in\nthe Medicaid expansion by taking away their existing Medicaid fund-\ning. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c. The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a\nState\u2019s overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States\nwith no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion. The\nGovernment claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a\nmodification of the existing program, and that this modification is\npermissible because Congress reserved the \u201cright to alter, amend, or\nrepeal any provision\u201d of Medicaid. \u00a71304. But the expansion accom-\nplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree. The original program was\ndesigned to cover medical services for particular categories of vulner-\nable individuals. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is trans-\nformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire\nnonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty\nlevel. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress\u2019s reservation of\nthe right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the Medicaid program included the\npower to transform it so dramatically. The Medicaid expansion thus\nviolates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their\nexisting Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expan-\nsion. Pp. 51\u201355.\n      (c) The constitutional violation is fully remedied by precluding\nthe Secretary from applying \u00a71396c to withdraw existing Medicaid\nfunds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the ex-\npansion. See \u00a71303. The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act\nare not affected. Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to\nstand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether\nto participate in the Medicaid expansion. Pp. 55\u201358.\n   6. JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, is of the view\nthat the Spending Clause does not preclude the Secretary from with-\nholding Medicaid funds based on a State\u2019s refusal to comply with the\n6            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    expanded Medicaid program. But given the majority view, she\n    agrees with THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s conclusion in Part IV\u2013B that the\n    Medicaid Act\u2019s severability clause, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71303, determines the\n    appropriate remedy. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the withhold-\n    ing\u2014not the granting\u2014of federal funds incompatible with the Spend-\n    ing Clause, Congress\u2019 extension of Medicaid remains available to any\n    State that affirms its willingness to participate. Even absent \u00a71303\u2019s\n    command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding\n    offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down\n    the ACA in its entirety. When a court confronts an unconstitutional\n    statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.\n    See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546\n    U. S. 320, 328\u2013330. Pp. 60\u201361.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n2010: the individual mandate, which requires individuals\nto purchase a health insurance policy providing a mini-\nmum level of coverage; and the Medicaid expansion, which\ngives funds to the States on the condition that they pro-\nvide specified health care to all citizens whose income falls\nbelow a certain threshold. We do not consider whether the\nAct embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted\nto the Nation\u2019s elected leaders. We ask only whether\nCongress has the power under the Constitution to enact\nthe challenged provisions.\n  In our federal system, the National Government pos-\nsesses only limited powers; the States and the people\nretain the remainder. Nearly two centuries ago, Chief\nJustice Marshall observed that \u201cthe question respecting\nthe extent of the powers actually granted\u201d to the Federal\nGovernment \u201cis perpetually arising, and will probably\ncontinue to arise, as long as our system shall exist.\u201d\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819). In this\ncase we must again determine whether the Constitution\ngrants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many\nStates and individuals believe it does not possess. Resolv-\ning this controversy requires us to examine both the limits\nof the Government\u2019s power, and our own limited role in\npolicing those boundaries.\n  The Federal Government \u201cis acknowledged by all to\nbe one of enumerated powers.\u201d Ibid. That is, rather\nthan granting general authority to perform all the conceiv-\nable functions of government, the Constitution lists, or\nenumerates, the Federal Government\u2019s powers. Congress\nmay, for example, \u201ccoin Money,\u201d \u201cestablish Post Offices,\u201d\nand \u201craise and support Armies.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 5, 7, 12.\nThe enumeration of powers is also a limitation of pow-\ners, because \u201c[t]he enumeration presupposes something not\nenumerated.\u201d Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824).\nThe Constitution\u2019s express conferral of some powers\nmakes clear that it does not grant others. And the Federal\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

J.\n\nGovernment \u201ccan exercise only the powers granted to it.\u201d\nMcCulloch, supra, at 405.\n   Today, the restrictions on government power foremost in\nmany Americans\u2019 minds are likely to be affirmative pro-\nhibitions, such as contained in the Bill of Rights. These\naffirmative prohibitions come into play, however, only where\nthe Government possesses authority to act in the first\nplace. If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to\npass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it\nwould not violate any of the express prohibitions in the\nBill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution.\n   Indeed, the Constitution did not initially include a Bill\nof Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enu-\nmeration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government.\nAs Alexander Hamilton put it, \u201cthe Constitution is itself,\nin every rational sense, and to every useful purpose,\nA BILL OF RIGHTS.\u201d The Federalist No. 84, p. 515 (C. Ros-\nsiter ed. 1961). And when the Bill of Rights was ratified,\nit made express what the enumeration of powers neces-\nsarily implied: \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United\nStates by the Constitution . . . are reserved to the States\nrespectively, or to the people.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.\nThe Federal Government has expanded dramatically over\nthe past two centuries, but it still must show that a consti-\ntutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions. See,\ne.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n   The same does not apply to the States, because the Con-\nstitution is not the source of their power. The Consti-\ntution may restrict state governments\u2014as it does, for\nexample, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal\nprotection of the laws. But where such prohibitions do\nnot apply, state governments do not need constitutional au-\nthorization to act. The States thus can and do perform\nmany of the vital functions of modern government\u2014\npunishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning\nproperty for development, to name but a few\u2014even though\n4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe Constitution\u2019s text does not authorize any government\nto do so. Our cases refer to this general power of govern-\ning, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Gov-\nernment, as the \u201cpolice power.\u201d See, e.g., United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618\u2013619 (2000).\n   \u201cState sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather,\nfederalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from\nthe diffusion of sovereign power.\u201d New York v. United\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because the police power is controlled by\n50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the\nfacets of governing that touch on citizens\u2019 daily lives are\nnormally administered by smaller governments closer to\nthe governed. The Framers thus ensured that powers\nwhich \u201cin the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives,\nliberties, and properties of the people\u201d were held by gov-\nernments more local and more accountable than a dis-\ntant federal bureaucracy. The Federalist No. 45, at 293\n(J. Madison). The independent power of the States also\nserves as a check on the power of the Federal Government:\n\u201cBy denying any one government complete jurisdiction\nover all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the\nliberty of the individual from arbitrary power.\u201d Bond v.\nUnited States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n   This case concerns two powers that the Constitution\ndoes grant the Federal Government, but which must be\nread carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority\nakin to the police power. The Constitution authorizes\nCongress to \u201cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and\namong the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3. Our precedents read that to mean that\nCongress may regulate \u201cthe channels of interstate com-\nmerce,\u201d \u201cpersons or things in interstate commerce,\u201d and\n\u201cthose activities that substantially affect interstate com-\nmerce.\u201d Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).

That power\nhas been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem-\ningly local matters as a farmer\u2019s decision to grow wheat\nfor himself and his livestock, and a loan shark\u2019s extor-\ntionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop.\nSee Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Perez v.\nUnited States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971).\n   Congress may also \u201clay and collect Taxes, Duties, Im-\nposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the\ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United\nStates.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. Put simply, Con-\ngress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal\nGovernment considerable influence even in areas where\nit cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may\nenact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid,\nor otherwise control. See, e.g., License Tax Cases, 5 Wall.\n462, 471 (1867). And in exercising its spending power,\nCongress may offer funds to the States, and may condition\nthose offers on compliance with specified conditions. See,\ne.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecond-\nary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999). These\noffers may well induce the States to adopt policies that\nthe Federal Government itself could not impose. See, e.g.,\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 205\u2013206 (1987) (con-\nditioning federal highway funds on States raising their\ndrinking age to 21).\n   The reach of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated\npowers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes\nCongress to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. We have long read this provision to give\nCongress great latitude in exercising its powers: \u201cLet the\nend be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitu-\ntion, and all means which are appropriate, which are\nplainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but\nconsist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are\n6        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v.

It is\nnot our job to protect the people from the consequences of\ntheir political choices.\n   Our deference in matters of policy cannot, however,\nbecome abdication in matters of law. \u201cThe powers of the\nlegislature are defined and limited; and that those lim-\nits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is\nwritten.\u201d Marbury v.

The Act aims to in-\ncrease the number of Americans covered by health in-\nsurance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act\u2019s 10\ntitles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of\nprovisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to\ntwo key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual\nmandate and the Medicaid expansion.\n   The individual mandate requires most Americans to\nmaintain \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage.\n26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A. The mandate does not apply to some\nindividuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.\n\u00a75000A(d). Many individuals will receive the required cov-\nerage through their employer, or from a government pro-\ngram such as Medicaid or Medicare. See \u00a75000A(f). But\nfor individuals who are not exempt and do not receive\nhealth insurance through a third party, the means of\nsatisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a\nprivate company.\n   Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the\nmandate must make a \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d\nto the Federal Government. \u00a75000A(b)(1). That payment,\nwhich the Act describes as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d is calculated as a\npercentage of household income, subject to a floor based on\na specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the aver-\nage annual premium the individual would have to pay for\nqualifying private health insurance. \u00a75000A(c). In 2016,\nfor example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ-\nual\u2019s household income, but no less than $695 and no more\nthan the average yearly premium for insurance that co-\nvers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g.,\nprescription drugs and hospitalization). Ibid.; 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718022. The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to\nthe Internal Revenue Service with an individual\u2019s taxes,\nand \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\u201d\n8        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

And some individuals who are sub-\nject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the\npenalty\u2014for example, those with income below a certain\nthreshold and members of Indian tribes. \u00a75000A(e).\n   On the day the President signed the Act into law, Flor-\nida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Florida. Those\nplaintiffs\u2014who are both respondents and petitioners here,\ndepending on the issue\u2014were subsequently joined by 13\nmore States, several individuals, and the National Fed-\neration of Independent Business. The plaintiffs alleged,\namong other things, that the individual mandate provi-\nsions of the Act exceeded Congress\u2019s powers under Article\nI of the Constitution. The District Court agreed, holding\nthat Congress lacked constitutional power to enact the\nindividual mandate. 780 F. Supp. 2d 1256 (ND Fla. 2011).\nThe District Court determined that the individual man-\ndate could not be severed from the remainder of the Act,\nand therefore struck down the Act in its entirety. Id., at\n1305\u20131306.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed\nin part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s holding that the individual mandate exceeds\nCongress\u2019s power. 648 F. 3d 1235 (2011). The panel\nunanimously agreed that the individual mandate did not\nimpose a tax, and thus could not be authorized by Con-\ngress\u2019s power to \u201clay and collect Taxes.\u201d U. S. Const.,\nArt.

Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individ-\nual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear\neffect on interstate commerce.\n   Having held the individual mandate to be unconstitu-\ntional, the majority examined whether that provision\ncould be severed from the remainder of the Act. The ma-\njority determined that, contrary to the District Court\u2019s\nview, it could. The court thus struck down only the indi-\nvidual mandate, leaving the Act\u2019s other provisions intact.\n648 F. 3d, at 1328.\n   Other Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to\nthe individual mandate. The Sixth Circuit and the D. C.\nCircuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Con-\ngress\u2019s commerce power. See Thomas More Law Center v.\nObama, 651 F. 3d 529 (CA6 2011); Seven-Sky v. Holder,\n661 F. 3d 1 (CADC 2011). The Fourth Circuit determined\nthat the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from consid-\nering the merits of that question. See Liberty Univ., Inc.\nv. Geithner, 671 F. 3d 391 (2011). That statute bars suits\n\u201cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection\nof any tax.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77421(a). A majority of the Fourth\nCircuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate\u2019s\npenalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction\nAct, because it is a financial assessment collected by the\nIRS through the normal means of taxation. The majority\ntherefore determined that the plaintiffs could not chal-\nlenge the individual mandate until after they paid the\npenalty.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Eleventh Circuit did not consider whether the Anti-Injunction\n\nAct bars challenges to the individual mandate. The District Court had\ndetermined that it did not, and neither side challenged that holding on\nappeal. The same was true in the Fourth Circuit, but that court\nexamined the question sua sponte because it viewed the Anti-Injunction\nAct as a limit on its subject matter jurisdiction. See Liberty Univ., 671\n10         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                   Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.\n                     Opinion R the Court \n\n\n   The second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly\nchallenged here is the Medicaid expansion. Enacted in\n1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist\npregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the\nelderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10). In order to receive that funding,\nStates must comply with federal criteria governing mat-\nters such as who receives care and what services are pro-\nvided at what cost. By 1982 every State had chosen to\nparticipate in Medicaid. Federal funds received through\nthe Medicaid program have become a substantial part of\nstate budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most\nStates\u2019 total revenue.\n   The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medi-\ncaid program and increases the number of individuals the\nStates must cover. For example, the Act requires state\nprograms to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with\nincomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level,\nwhereas many States now cover adults with children only\nif their income is considerably lower, and do not cover\nchildless adults at all. See \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The\nAct increases federal funding to cover the States\u2019 costs in\nexpanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a\nportion of the costs on their own. \u00a71396d(y)(1). If a State\ndoes not comply with the Act\u2019s new coverage require-\nments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those\nrequirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. See\n\u00a71396c.\n   Along with their challenge to the individual mandate,\nthe state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the\nMedicaid expansion exceeds Congress\u2019s constitutional\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nF. 3d, at 400\u2013401.

The Court of Appeals unanimously held that the\nMedicaid expansion is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power\nunder the Spending Clause. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1.\nAnd the court rejected the States\u2019 claim that the threat-\nened loss of all federal Medicaid funding violates the\nTenth Amendment by coercing them into complying with\nthe Medicaid expansion. 648 F. 3d, at 1264, 1268.\n  We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with respect to\nboth the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.\n565 U. S. ___ (2011). Because no party supports the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s holding that the individual mandate can\nbe completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable\nCare Act, we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that\naspect of the judgment below. And because there is a\nreasonable argument that the Anti-Injunction Act de-\nprives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ-\nual mandate, but no party supports that proposition, we\nappointed an amicus curiae to advance it.2\n                              II\n   Before turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have\nthe authority to do so. The Anti-Injunction Act provides\nthat \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment\nor collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court\nby any person, whether or not such person is the per-\nson against whom such tax was assessed.\u201d 26 U.

Williams Packing & Nav. Co., 370 U. S. 1,\n7\u20138 (1962).\n   The penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care\nAct\u2019s individual mandate first becomes enforceable in\n2014. The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to\nrestrain the penalty\u2019s future collection. Amicus contends\nthat the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a\ntax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this\nsuit.\n   The text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.\nThe Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits \u201cfor the purpose\nof restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d\n\u00a77421(a) (emphasis added). Congress, however, chose to\ndescribe the \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d imposed on\nthose who forgo health insurance not as a \u201ctax,\u201d but as a\n\u201cpenalty.\u201d \u00a7\u00a75000A(b), (g)(2). There is no immediate\nreason to think that a statute applying to \u201cany tax\u201d would\napply to a \u201cpenalty.\u201d\n   Congress\u2019s decision to label this exaction a \u201cpenalty\u201d\nrather than a \u201ctax\u201d is significant because the Affordable\nCare Act describes many other exactions it creates as\n\u201ctaxes.\u201d See Thomas More, 651 F. 3d, at 551. Where\nCongress uses certain language in one part of a statute\nand different language in another, it is generally pre-\nsumed that Congress acts intentionally. See Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).\n   Amicus argues that even though Congress did not label\nthe shared responsibility payment a tax, we should treat it\nas such under the Anti-Injunction Act because it functions\nlike a tax. It is true that Congress cannot change whether\nan exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur-\nposes simply by describing it as one or the other. Congress\nmay not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing\nClause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019s constraint\non criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial pun-\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

S. 767, 779 (1994).\n   The Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act,\nhowever, are creatures of Congress\u2019s own creation. How\nthey relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best\nevidence of Congress\u2019s intent is the statutory text. We\nhave thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily\ndescribed \u201ctaxes\u201d even where that label was inaccurate.\nSee Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16 (1922) (Anti-Injunction\nAct applies to \u201cChild Labor Tax\u201d struck down as exceeding\nCongress\u2019s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).\n   Congress can, of course, describe something as a penalty\nbut direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for pur-\nposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. For example, 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a76671(a) provides that \u201cany reference in this title to \u2018tax\u2019\nimposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the\npenalties and liabilities provided by\u201d subchapter 68B of\nthe Internal Revenue Code. Penalties in subchapter 68B\nare thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes\nthe Anti-Injunction Act. The individual mandate, how-\never, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code. Nor does any\nother provision state that references to taxes in Title 26\nshall also be \u201cdeemed\u201d to apply to the individual mandate.\n   Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the\nAnti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate,\nalbeit by a more circuitous route. Section 5000A(g)(1) spec-\nifies that the penalty for not complying with the man-\ndate \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\nas an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter\n68.\u201d Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn,\n\u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner as\ntaxes.\u201d \u00a76671(a). According to amicus, by directing that\nthe penalty be \u201cassessed and collected in the same man-\nner as taxes,\u201d \u00a75000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act\napplicable to this penalty.\n14       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

It argues that \u00a75000A(g)(1)\ndoes not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act,\nbecause \u00a75000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of\nthe Treasury to use the same \u201c \u2018methodology and proce-\ndures\u2019 \u201d to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.\nBrief for United States 32\u201333 (quoting Seven-Sky, 661\nF. 3d, at 11).\n   We think the Government has the better reading. As\nit observes, \u201cAssessment\u201d and \u201cCollection\u201d are chapters of\nthe Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author-\nity to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying\nthe means by which he shall do so. See \u00a76201 (assess-\nment authority); \u00a76301 (collection authority). Section\n5000A(g)(1)\u2019s command that the penalty be \u201cassessed and\ncollected in the same manner\u201d as taxes is best read as\nreferring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the\nsame authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.\nThat interpretation is consistent with the remainder of\n\u00a75000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he\nmay use to collect the penalty. See \u00a75000A(g)(2)(A) (bar-\nring criminal prosecutions); \u00a75000A(g)(2)(B) (prohibiting\nthe Secretary from using notices of lien and levies). The\nAnti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the\nprocedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.\n   Amicus argues in the alternative that a different section\nof the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the\npenalty as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. Section\n6201(a) authorizes the Secretary to make \u201cassessments of\nall taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions\nto the tax, and assessable penalties).\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAmicus contends that the penalty must be a tax, because\nit is an assessable penalty and \u00a76201(a) says that taxes\ninclude assessable penalties.\n   That argument has force only if \u00a76201(a) is read in\nisolation. The Code contains many provisions treating\ntaxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms. See, e.g.,\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

There\nwould, for example, be no need for \u00a76671(a) to deem \u201ctax\u201d\nto refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code al-\nready included all such penalties in the term \u201ctax.\u201d In-\ndeed, amicus\u2019s earlier observation that the Code requires\nassessable penalties to be assessed and collected \u201cin the\nsame manner as taxes\u201d makes little sense if assessable\npenalties are themselves taxes. In light of the Code\u2019s\nconsistent distinction between the terms \u201ctax\u201d and \u201cas-\nsessable penalty,\u201d we must accept the Government\u2019s in-\nterpretation: \u00a76201(a) instructs the Secretary that his\nauthority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess\npenalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to\ntaxes for other purposes.\n  The Affordable Care Act does not require that the pen-\nalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be\ntreated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\nThe Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this\nsuit, and we may proceed to the merits.\n                              III\n   The Government advances two theories for the proposi-\ntion that Congress had constitutional authority to enact\nthe individual mandate. First, the Government argues\nthat Congress had the power to enact the mandate under\nthe Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may\norder individuals to buy health insurance because the\nfailure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could un-\ndercut the Affordable Care Act\u2019s other reforms. Second,\nthe Government argues that if the commerce power does\nnot support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it\nas an exercise of Congress\u2019s power to tax. According to the\nGovernment, even if Congress lacks the power to direct\nindividuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the indi-\nvidual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so,\nand thus the law may be upheld as a tax.\n16       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n                              A\n  The Government\u2019s first argument is that the individual\nmandate is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the\nCommerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.\nAccording to the Government, the health care market is\ncharacterized by a significant cost-shifting problem. Every-\none will eventually need health care at a time and to an\nextent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insur-\nance, they often will not be able to pay for it. Because\nstate and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to\nprovide a certain degree of care to individuals without\nregard to their ability to pay, see, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395dd;\nFla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7395.1041, hospitals end up receiving\ncompensation for only a portion of the services they pro-\nvide. To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to\ninsurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass\non the cost to policy holders in the form of higher pre-\nmiums. Congress estimated that the cost of uncompen-\nsated care raises family health insurance premiums, on\naverage, by over $1,000 per year. 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(F).\n  In the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the\nproblem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage\nbecause of preexisting conditions or other health issues. It\ndid so through the Act\u2019s \u201cguaranteed-issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity-\nrating\u201d provisions. These provisions together prohibit in-\nsurance companies from denying coverage to those with\nsuch conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher\npremiums than healthy individuals. See \u00a7\u00a7300gg, 300gg\u20131,\n300gg\u20133, 300gg\u20134.\n  The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do\nnot, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who\nchoose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health\ncare needs. In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that\nproblem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay\npurchasing health insurance until they become sick, rely-\ning on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             17\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nThe reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on\ninsurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals\nbut prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay\nfor their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly\nincrease premiums on everyone. See Brief for America\u2019s\nHealth Insurance Plans et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11\u2013\n393 etc. 8\u20139.\n  The individual mandate was Congress\u2019s solution to\nthese problems. By requiring that individuals purchase\nhealth insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by\nthose who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the\nmandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy\nindividuals, whose premiums on average will be higher\nthan their health care expenses. This allows insurers to\nsubsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals\nthe reforms require them to accept. The Government\nclaims that Congress has power under the Commerce and\nNecessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.\n                               1\n   The Government contends that the individual mandate\nis within Congress\u2019s power because the failure to pur-\nchase insurance \u201chas a substantial and deleterious effect\non interstate commerce\u201d by creating the cost-shifting prob-\nlem. Brief for United States 34. The path of our Com-\nmerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, see\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 552\u2013559 (1995), but\nit is now well established that Congress has broad author-\nity under the Clause. We have recognized, for example,\nthat \u201c[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is\nnot confined to the regulation of commerce among the\nstates,\u201d but extends to activities that \u201chave a substantial\neffect on interstate commerce.\u201d United States v. Darby,\n312 U. S. 100, 118\u2013119 (1941). Congress\u2019s power, more-\nover, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends\n18          NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                    BUSINESS v.

S., at 127\u2013128.\n   Given its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Con-\ngress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety\nof ways to address the pressing needs of the time. But\nCongress has never attempted to rely on that power to\ncompel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase\nan unwanted product.3 Legislative novelty is not nec-\nessarily fatal; there is a first time for everything. But\nsometimes \u201cthe most telling indication of [a] severe con-\nstitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent\u201d\nfor Congress\u2019s action. Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Com-\npany Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 25) (internal quotation marks omitted). At the\nvery least, we should \u201cpause to consider the implications of\nthe Government\u2019s arguments\u201d when confronted with such\nnew conceptions of federal power. Lopez, supra, at 564.\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power to \u201cregulate\nCommerce.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power\nto regulate commerce presupposes the existence of com-\nmercial activity to be regulated. If the power to \u201cregulate\u201d\nsomething included the power to create it, many of the\nprovisions in the Constitution would be superfluous. For\nexample, the Constitution gives Congress the power to\n\u201ccoin Money,\u201d in addition to the power to \u201cregulate the\nValue thereof.\u201d Id., cl. 5.

If the power to regulate the\narmed forces or the value of money included the power to\nbring the subject of the regulation into existence, the\nspecific grant of such powers would have been unneces-\nsary. The language of the Constitution reflects the natu-\nral understanding that the power to regulate assumes\nthere is already something to be regulated. See Gibbons, 9\nWheat., at 188 (\u201c[T]he enlightened patriots who framed\nour constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be\nunderstood to have employed words in their natural sense,\nand to have intended what they have said\u201d).4\n  Our precedent also reflects this understanding. As\nexpansive as our cases construing the scope of the com-\nmerce power have been, they all have one thing in com-\nmon: They uniformly describe the power as reaching\n\u201cactivity.\u201d It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when\nquoting them. See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at 560 (\u201cWhere\neconomic activity substantially affects interstate com-\nmerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sus-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 JUSTICE  GINSBURG suggests that \u201cat the time the Constitution was\nframed, to \u2018regulate\u2019 meant, among other things, to require action.\u201d\nPost, at 23 (citing Seven-Sky v. Holder, 661 F. 3d 1, 16 (CADC 2011);\nbrackets and some internal quotation marks omitted). But to reach\nthis conclusion, the case cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG relied on a diction-\nary in which \u201c[t]o order; to command\u201d was the fifth-alternative defini-\ntion of \u201cto direct,\u201d which was itself the second-alternative definition of\n\u201cto regulate.\u201d See Seven-Sky, supra, at 16 (citing S.

It is\nunlikely that the Framers had such an obscure meaning in mind when\nthey used the word \u201cregulate.\u201d Far more commonly, \u201c[t]o regulate\u201d\nmeant \u201c[t]o adjust by rule or method,\u201d which presupposes something to\nadjust. 2 Johnson, supra, at 1619; see also Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 196\n(defining the commerce power as the power \u201cto prescribe the rule by\nwhich commerce is to be governed\u201d).\n20         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v.

Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by\npointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring\ncountless decisions an individual could potentially make\nwithin the scope of federal regulation, and\u2014under the\nGovernment\u2019s theory\u2014empower Congress to make those\ndecisions for him.\n   Applying the Government\u2019s logic to the familiar case of\nWickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry\nus from the notion of a government of limited powers. In\nWickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im-\nposed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption\non his own farm. 317 U. S., at 114\u2013115, 128\u2013129. That\namount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota\nunder a program designed to support the price of wheat by\nlimiting supply. The Court rejected the farmer\u2019s argument\nthat growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the\nreach of the commerce power. It did so on the ground that\nthe farmer\u2019s decision to grow wheat for his own use al-\nlowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market. That\ndecision, when considered in the aggregate along with sim-\nilar decisions of others, would have had a substantial ef-\nfect on the interstate market for wheat. Id., at 127\u2013129.\n   Wickard has long been regarded as \u201cperhaps the most\nfar reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over\nintrastate activity,\u201d Lopez, 514 U. S., at 560, but the Gov-\nernment\u2019s theory in this case would go much further.\nUnder Wickard it is within Congress\u2019s power to regulate\nthe market for wheat by supporting its price. But price\ncan be supported by increasing demand as well as by\ndecreasing supply. The aggregated decisions of some\nconsumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect\non the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase\nhealth insurance have on the price of insurance. Congress\ncan therefore command that those not buying wheat do so,\njust as it argues here that it may command that those not\n22       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nbuying health insurance do so. The farmer in Wickard\nwas at least actively engaged in the production of wheat,\nand the Government could regulate that activity because\nof its effect on commerce. The Government\u2019s theory here\nwould effectively override that limitation, by establishing\nthat individuals may be regulated under the Commerce\nClause whenever enough of them are not doing something\nthe Government would have them do.\n   Indeed, the Government\u2019s logic would justify a manda-\ntory purchase to solve almost any problem. See Seven-Sky,\n661 F. 3d, at 14\u201315 (noting the Government\u2019s inability\nto \u201cidentify any mandate to purchase a product or ser-\nvice in interstate commerce that would be unconstitu-\ntional\u201d under its theory of the commerce power). To\nconsider a different example in the health care market, many\nAmericans do not eat a balanced diet. That group makes\nup a larger percentage of the total population than those\nwithout health insurance. See, e.g., Dept. of Agriculture\nand Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dietary Guide-\nlines for Americans 1 (2010). The failure of that group\nto have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a\ngreater extent than the failure of the uninsured to pur-\nchase insurance. See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, &\nDietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity:\nPayer- and Service-Specific Estimates, 28 Health Affairs\nw822 (2009) (detailing the \u201cundeniable link between ris-\ning rates of obesity and rising medical spending,\u201d and esti-\nmating that \u201cthe annual medical burden of obesity has\nrisen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and\ncould amount to $147 billion per year in 2008\u201d). Those in-\ncreased costs are borne in part by other Americans who\nmust pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the\ninsured. See Center for Applied Ethics, Voluntary Health\nRisks: Who Should Pay?, 6 Issues in Ethics 6 (1993) (not-\ning \u201coverwhelming evidence that individuals with un-\nhealthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

J.\n\nwith their behaviors; most of the expense is borne by the\nrest of society in the form of higher insurance premiums,\ngovernment expenditures for health care, and disability\nbenefits\u201d). Congress addressed the insurance problem by\nordering everyone to buy insurance. Under the Gov-\nernment\u2019s theory, Congress could address the diet problem\nby ordering everyone to buy vegetables. See Dietary\nGuidelines, supra, at 19 (\u201cImproved nutrition, appropriate\neating behaviors, and increased physical activity have tre-\nmendous potential to . . . reduce health care costs\u201d).\n   People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things\nthat would be good for them or good for society. Those\nfailures\u2014joined with the similar failures of others\u2014can\nreadily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\nUnder the Government\u2019s logic, that authorizes Congress to\nuse its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the\nGovernment would have them act.\n   That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution\nenvisioned. James Madison explained that the Commerce\nClause was \u201can addition which few oppose and from which\nno apprehensions are entertained.\u201d The Federalist No. 45,\nat 293. While Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce\nClause has of course expanded with the growth of the\nnational economy, our cases have \u201calways recognized that\nthe power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has\nlimits.\u201d Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968). The\nGovernment\u2019s theory would erode those limits, permitting\nCongress to reach beyond the natural extent of its author-\nity, \u201ceverywhere extending the sphere of its activity and\ndrawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\u201d The Feder-\nalist No. 48, at 309 (J.

United States, 199 U.

There is no reason to depart from that un-\nderstanding now.\n   The Government sees things differently.

Individuals are no more\n\u201cactiv[e] in the self-insurance market\u201d when they fail to purchase\ninsurance, ibid., than they are active in the \u201crest\u201d market when doing\nnothing.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

J.\n\nactive participation\u2014requiring that they do so through\ninsurance, rather than through attempted self-insurance\nwith the back-stop of shifting costs to others.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Government repeats the phrase \u201cactive in the mar-\nket for health care\u201d throughout its brief, see id., at 7, 18,\n34, 50, but that concept has no constitutional significance.\nAn individual who bought a car two years ago and may\nbuy another in the future is not \u201cactive in the car market\u201d\nin any pertinent sense. The phrase \u201cactive in the market\u201d\ncannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by\nthe individual mandate are not currently engaged in any\ncommercial activity involving health care, and that fact is\nfatal to the Government\u2019s effort to \u201cregulate the uninsured\nas a class.\u201d Id., at 42. Our precedents recognize Con-\ngress\u2019s power to regulate \u201cclass[es] of activities,\u201d Gonzales\nv. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 17 (2005) (emphasis added), not\nclasses of individuals, apart from any activity in which\nthey are engaged, see, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 153 (\u201cPeti-\ntioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in\n\u2018extortionate credit transactions\u2019 . . .\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n   The individual mandate\u2019s regulation of the uninsured as\na class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to\nexisting commercial activity. The mandate primarily\naffects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to\nneed significant health care and have other priorities for\nspending their money. It is precisely because these indi-\nviduals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health\ncare costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of\nforcing insurance companies to cover others who impose\ngreater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect.\nSee 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(I) (recognizing that the mandate\nwould \u201cbroaden the health insurance risk pool to include\nhealthy individuals, which will lower health insurance\npremiums\u201d). If the individual mandate is targeted at a\nclass, it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than\nactivity is its defining feature.\n26       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The Government, however, claims that this does not\nmatter. The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger\nCongress\u2019s authority that almost all those who are unin-\nsured will, at some unknown point in the future, engage\nin a health care transaction. Asserting that \u201c[t]here is no\ntemporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,\u201d the Gov-\nernment argues that because \u201c[e]veryone subject to this\nregulation is in or will be in the health care market,\u201d they\ncan be \u201cregulated in advance.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 109 (Mar.\n27, 2012).\n   The proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct\nof an individual today because of prophesied future ac-\ntivity finds no support in our precedent. We have said that\nCongress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco-\nnomic activity. See, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB,\n305 U. S. 197 (1938) (regulating the labor practices of\nutility companies); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United\nStates, 379 U. S. 241 (1964) (prohibiting discrimination by\nhotel operators); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294\n(1964) (prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners).\nBut we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that\nactivity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently\nengaged in commerce. Each one of our cases, including\nthose cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 20\u201321, involved\npreexisting economic activity. See, e.g., Wickard, 317\nU. S., at 127\u2013129 (producing wheat); Raich, supra, at 25\n(growing marijuana).\n   Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food,\nclothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not\nauthorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular\nproducts in those or other markets today. The Commerce\nClause is not a general license to regulate an individual\nfrom cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably\nengage in particular transactions. Any police power to\nregulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities,\nremains vested in the States.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           27\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The Government argues that the individual mandate\ncan be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because\nhealth insurance is a unique product. According to the\nGovernment, upholding the individual mandate would\nnot justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or\nbroccoli because, as the Government puts it, \u201c[h]ealth in-\nsurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or\nbroccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consump-\ntion and covering universal risks.\u201d Reply Brief for United\nStates 19. But cars and broccoli are no more purchased\nfor their \u201cown sake\u201d than health insurance. They are\npurchased to cover the need for transportation and food.\n   The Government says that health insurance and health\ncare financing are \u201cinherently integrated.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 41. But that does not mean the compelled purchase\nof the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the\nsecond. No matter how \u201cinherently integrated\u201d health\ninsurance and health care consumption may be, they are\nnot the same thing: They involve different transactions,\nentered into at different times, with different providers.\nAnd for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant\nhealth care needs will be years, or even decades, away.\nThe proximity and degree of connection between the\nmandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lack-\ning to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Gov-\nernment.      The individual mandate forces individuals\ninto commerce precisely because they elected to refrain\nfrom commercial activity. Such a law cannot be sus-\ntained under a clause authorizing Congress to \u201cregulate\nCommerce.\u201d\n                           2\n  The Government next contends that Congress has the\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the\nindividual mandate because the mandate is an \u201cintegral\npart of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation\u201d\u2014\n28       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v.

Under this argu-\nment, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an\nindividual\u2019s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it\nis enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a\nway that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.\n   The power to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary\nand proper for carrying into Execution\u201d the powers enu-\nmerated in the Constitution, Art.

Although the Clause\ngives Congress authority to \u201clegislate on that vast mass\nof incidental powers which must be involved in the con-\nstitution,\u201d it does not license the exercise of any \u201cgreat\nsubstantive and independent power[s]\u201d beyond those specifi-\ncally enumerated.

Each\nof our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause in-\nvolved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service\nto, a granted power. For example, we have upheld provi-\nsions permitting continued confinement of those already\nin federal custody when they could not be safely released,\nComstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132); criminaliz-\ning bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds,\nSabri v.

The individual mandate, by con-\ntrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to\ncreate the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enu-\nmerated power.\n   This is in no way an authority that is \u201cnarrow in scope,\u201d\nComstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20), or \u201cincidental\u201d to\nthe exercise of the commerce power, McCulloch, supra, at\n418. Rather, such a conception of the Necessary and\nProper Clause would work a substantial expansion of\nfederal authority. No longer would Congress be limited to\nregulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some\npreexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of\nfederal regulation. Instead, Congress could reach beyond\n30       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe natural limit of its authority and draw within its\nregulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of\nit. Even if the individual mandate is \u201cnecessary\u201d to the\nAct\u2019s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal\npower is not a \u201cproper\u201d means for making those reforms\neffective.\n   The Government relies primarily on our decision in\nGonzales v. Raich. In Raich, we considered \u201ccomprehen-\nsive legislation to regulate the interstate market\u201d in mari-\njuana. 545 U. S., at 22. Certain individuals sought an\nexemption from that regulation on the ground that they\nengaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.\nWe denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana\nis a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could\nbe readily diverted into the interstate market. Congress\u2019s\nattempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana\nwould therefore have been substantially undercut if it\ncould not also regulate intrastate possession and con-\nsumption. Id., at 19. Accordingly, we recognized that\n\u201cCongress was acting well within its authority\u201d under the\nNecessary and Proper Clause even though its \u201cregulation\nensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.\u201d Id., at 22; see\nalso Perez, 402 U. S., at 154. Raich thus did not involve\nthe exercise of any \u201cgreat substantive and independent\npower,\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.\nInstead, it concerned only the constitutionality of \u201cindi-\nvidual applications of a concededly valid statutory\nscheme.\u201d Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).\n   Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as\na law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to\npurchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as\na \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d component of the insurance re-\nforms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the\nmandate. Accord, post, at 4\u201316 (joint opinion of SCALIA,\nKENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Because the Com-\nmerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it\nis necessary to turn to the Government\u2019s second argument:\nthat the mandate may be upheld as within Congress\u2019s\nenumerated power to \u201clay and collect Taxes.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl. 1.\n   The Government\u2019s tax power argument asks us to view\nthe statute differently than we did in considering its com-\nmerce power theory. In making its Commerce Clause\nargument, the Government defended the mandate as a\nregulation requiring individuals to purchase health in-\nsurance. The Government does not claim that the taxing\npower allows Congress to issue such a command. Instead,\nthe Government asks us to read the mandate not as order-\ning individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a\ntax on those who do not buy that product.\n   The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one\npossible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that\nreads \u201cno vehicles in the park\u201d might, or might not, ban\nbicycles in the park. And it is well established that if\na statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates\nthe Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that\ndoes not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: \u201cNo\ncourt ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it una-\nvoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve\na violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.\u201d\nParsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448\u2013449 (1830). Justice\nHolmes made the same point a century later: \u201c[T]he rule is\nsettled that as between two possible interpretations of a\nstatute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and\nby the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which\nwill save the Act.\u201d Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148\n(1927) (concurring opinion).\n   The most straightforward reading of the mandate is\nthat it commands individuals to purchase insurance.\n32       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nAfter all, it states that individuals \u201cshall\u201d maintain health\ninsurance. 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(a). Congress thought it\ncould enact such a command under the Commerce Clause,\nand the Government primarily defended the law on that\nbasis. But, for the reasons explained above, the Com-\nmerce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under\nour precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the\nGovernment\u2019s alternative reading of the statute\u2014that it\nonly imposes a tax on those without insurance\u2014is a rea-\nsonable one.\n   Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain\nhealth insurance, the only consequence is that he must\nmake an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his\ntaxes. See \u00a75000A(b). That, according to the Government,\nmeans the mandate can be regarded as establishing a\ncondition\u2014not owning health insurance\u2014that triggers a\ntax\u2014the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory,\nthe mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.\nRather, it makes going without insurance just another\nthing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earn-\ning income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike\non certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it\nmay be within Congress\u2019s constitutional power to tax.\n   The question is not whether that is the most natural\ninterpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a\n\u201cfairly possible\u201d one. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62\n(1932). As we have explained, \u201cevery reasonable construc-\ntion must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from\nunconstitutionality.\u201d Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n657 (1895). The Government asks us to interpret the\nmandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate\nthe Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of\ndeference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for\nthe reasons set forth below.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

The \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment,\u201d as the\nstatute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by \u201ctax-\npayer[s]\u201d when they file their tax returns. 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a75000A(b). It does not apply to individuals who do not\npay federal income taxes because their household income\nis less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue\nCode. \u00a75000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the pay-\nment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as\ntaxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing\nstatus. \u00a7\u00a75000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to\npay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by\nthe IRS, which\u2014as we previously explained\u2014must assess\nand collect it \u201cin the same manner as taxes.\u201d Supra, at\n13\u201314. This process yields the essential feature of any tax:\nit produces at least some revenue for the Government.\nUnited States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22, 28, n. 4 (1953).\nIndeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion\nper year by 2017. Congressional Budget Office, Payments\nof Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Pro-\ntection and Affordable Care Act (Apr. 30, 2010), in Selected\nCBO Publications Related to Health Care Legislation,\n2009\u20132010, p. 71 (rev. 2010).\n   It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as\na \u201cpenalty,\u201d not a \u201ctax.\u201d But while that label is fatal to the\napplication of the Anti-Injunction Act, supra, at 12\u201313, it\ndoes not determine whether the payment may be viewed\nas an exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power. It is up to Con-\ngress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any\nparticular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Con-\ngress\u2019s choice of label on that question. That choice does\nnot, however, control whether an exaction is within Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional power to tax.\n   Our precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two\n34       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

In\nthe first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so-\ncalled tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act. George,\n259 U. S., at 20. Congress knew that suits to obstruct\ntaxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction\nAct; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress\ntherefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. In\nthe second case, however, we held that the same exaction,\nalthough labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Con-\ngress\u2019s taxing power. Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S., at 38.\nThat constitutional question was not controlled by Con-\ngress\u2019s choice of label.\n   We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes\nnonetheless were authorized by Congress\u2019s power to tax.\nIn the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal\nlicenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets\u2014for which the\nlicensee had to pay a fee\u2014could be sustained as exercises\nof the taxing power. 5 Wall., at 471. And in New York v.\nUnited States we upheld as a tax a \u201csurcharge\u201d on out-of-\nstate nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was\npaid to the Federal Treasury. 505 U. S., at 171. We thus\nask whether the shared responsibility payment falls\nwithin Congress\u2019s taxing power, \u201c[d]isregarding the designa-\ntion of the exaction, and viewing its substance and appli-\ncation.\u201d United States v.

For ex-\nample, in Drexel Furniture, we focused on three practical\ncharacteristics of the so-called tax on employing child\nlaborers that convinced us the \u201ctax\u201d was actually a pen-\nalty. First, the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy bur-\nden\u201410 percent of a company\u2019s net income\u2014on those who\nemployed children, no matter how small their infraction.\nSecond, it imposed that exaction only on those who know-\ningly employed underage laborers. Such scienter require-\nments are typical of punitive statutes, because Congress\noften wishes to punish only those who intentionally break\nthe law. Third, this \u201ctax\u201d was enforced in part by the\nDepartment of Labor, an agency responsible for pun-\nishing violations of labor laws, not collecting revenue. 259\nU.

Although the payment will\nraise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to ex-\npand health insurance coverage. But taxes that seek to\ninfluence conduct are nothing new.

That \u00a75000A seeks to shape\ndecisions about whether to buy health insurance does not\nmean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing\npower.\n   In distinguishing penalties from taxes, this Court has\nexplained that \u201cif the concept of penalty means anything,\nit means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.\u201d\nUnited States v.

S. 568, 572 (1931) (\u201c[A] penalty, as the\nword is here used, is an exaction imposed by statute as\npunishment for an unlawful act\u201d). While the individual\nmandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health\ninsurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do\nso is unlawful. Neither the Act nor any other law attaches\nnegative legal consequences to not buying health insur-\nance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. The Gov-\nernment agrees with that reading, confirming that if\nsomeone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insur-\nance, they have fully complied with the law.

See\nCongressional Budget Office, supra, at 71. We would\nexpect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such\nconduct were unlawful. That Congress apparently regards\nsuch extensive failure to comply with the mandate as\n38         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

It suggests instead that the\nshared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citi-\nzens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health\ninsurance.\n   The plaintiffs contend that Congress\u2019s choice of lan-\nguage\u2014stating that individuals \u201cshall\u201d obtain insurance\nor pay a \u201cpenalty\u201d\u2014requires reading \u00a75000A as punishing\nunlawful conduct, even if that interpretation would ren-\nder the law unconstitutional. We have rejected a similar\nargument before. In New York v.

S., at 169 (quoting 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72021c(a)(1)(A)). A State that shipped its waste to another\nState was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State,\na portion of which would be paid over to the Federal\nGovernment.       And a State that did not adhere to the\nstatutory scheme faced \u201c[p]enalties for failure to comply,\u201d\nincluding increases in the surcharge. \u00a72021e(e)(2); New\nYork, 505 U. S., at 152\u2013153. New York urged us to read\nthe statute as a federal command that the state legisla-\nture enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would\nhave violated the Constitution. To avoid that outcome, we\ninterpreted the statute to impose only \u201ca series of incen-\ntives\u201d for the State to take responsibility for its waste. We\nthen sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government\nas an exercise of the taxing power. Id., at 169\u2013174.

In effect, they contend that even if\nthe Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we\ninterpret this statute to do, the law must be struck down\nbecause Congress used the wrong labels. An example may\nhelp illustrate why labels should not control here. Sup-\npose Congress enacted a statute providing that every\ntaxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient win-\ndows must pay $50 to the IRS. The amount due is adjusted\nbased on factors such as taxable income and joint filing\nstatus, and is paid along with the taxpayer\u2019s income tax\nreturn. Those whose income is below the filing threshold\nneed not pay. The required payment is not called a \u201ctax,\u201d\na \u201cpenalty,\u201d or anything else. No one would doubt that\nthis law imposed a tax, and was within Congress\u2019s power\nto tax. That conclusion should not change simply because\nCongress used the word \u201cpenalty\u201d to describe the pay-\nment. Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly\n\u201c[i]mpos[e] a tax through judicial legislation.\u201d Post, at 25.\nRather, it would give practical effect to the Legislature\u2019s\nenactment.\n   Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the\npower to impose the exaction in \u00a75000A under the taxing\npower, and that \u00a75000A need not be read to do more than\nimpose a tax. That is sufficient to sustain it. The \u201cques-\ntion of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress\ndoes not depend on recitals of the power which it under-\ntakes to exercise.\u201d Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U.

J.\n                   Opinion R the Court \n\n\n138, 144 (1948).\n   Even if the taxing power enables Congress to impose\na tax on not obtaining health insurance, any tax must\nstill comply with other requirements in the Constitution.\nPlaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment\ndoes not do so, citing Article I, \u00a79, clause 4. That clause\nprovides: \u201cNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,\nunless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein\nbefore directed to be taken.\u201d This requirement means that\nany \u201cdirect Tax\u201d must be apportioned so that each State\npays in proportion to its population. According to the\nplaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a\ndirect tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress\nmade no effort to apportion it among the States.\n   Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was\nunclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as\na \u201chead tax\u201d or a \u201cpoll tax\u201d), might be a direct tax. See\nSpringer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586, 596\u2013598 (1881).\nSoon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on owner-\nship of carriages, over James Madison\u2019s objection that it\nwas an unapportioned direct tax. Id., at 597. This Court\nupheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such\na tax would make little sense, because it would have re-\nquired taxing carriage owners at dramatically different\nrates depending on how many carriages were in their\nhome State. See Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 174\n(1796) (opinion of Chase, J.). The Court was unanimous,\nand those Justices who wrote opinions either directly\nasserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of\ntaxation were direct: capitations and land taxes. See id.,\nat 175; id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 183\n(opinion of Iredell, J.).\n   That narrow view of what a direct tax might be per-\nsisted for a century. In 1880, for example, we explained that\n\u201cdirect taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are\nonly capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument,\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          41\n\n                   Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.\n                     Opinion R the Court\n\nand taxes on real estate.\u201d Springer, supra, at 602. In\n1895, we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on\npersonal property and income from personal property, in\nthe course of striking down aspects of the federal income\ntax. Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust Co., 158 U. S. 601,\n618 (1895). That result was overturned by the Sixteenth\nAmendment, although we continued to consider taxes on\npersonal property to be direct taxes. See Eisner v. Macom-\nber, 252 U. S. 189, 218\u2013219 (1920).\n  A tax on going without health insurance does not fall\nwithin any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a\ncapitation. Capitations are taxes paid by every person,\n\u201cwithout regard to property, profession, or any other cir-\ncumstance.\u201d Hylton, supra, at 175 (opinion of Chase, J.)\n(emphasis altered). The whole point of the shared respon-\nsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir-\ncumstances\u2014earning a certain amount of income but not\nobtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly\nnot a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.\nThe shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax\nthat must be apportioned among the several States.\n  There may, however, be a more fundamental objection\nto a tax on those who lack health insurance. Even if only\na tax, the payment under \u00a75000A(b) remains a burden\nthat the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not\nan act. If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause\nas authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain\nfrom commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to\npermit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.\n  Three considerations allay this concern. First, and most\nimportantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does\nnot guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through\ninactivity. A capitation, after all, is a tax that every-\none must pay simply for existing, and capitations are\nexpressly contemplated by the Constitution. The Court\ntoday holds that our Constitution protects us from federal\n42       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                 Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.\n                   Opinion R the Court \n\n\nregulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we ab-\nstain from the regulated activity. But from its creation,\nthe Constitution has made no such promise with respect to\ntaxes. See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy\n(Nov. 13, 1789) (\u201cOur new Constitution is now established\n. . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain,\nexcept death and taxes\u201d).\n    Whether the mandate can be upheld under the Com-\nmerce Clause is a question about the scope of federal\nauthority. Its answer depends on whether Congress can\nexercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of\ndirecting individuals to purchase insurance. Congress\u2019s\nuse of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something\nis, by contrast, not new. Tax incentives already promote,\nfor example, purchasing homes and professional educa-\ntions. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7163(h), 25A. Sustaining the\nmandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has\nproperly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchas-\ning health insurance, not whether it can. Upholding the\nindividual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does\nnot recognize any new federal power. It determines that\nCongress has used an existing one.\n    Second, Congress\u2019s ability to use its taxing power to\ninfluence conduct is not without limits. A few of our cases\npoliced these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive\nexactions obviously designed to regulate behavior other-\nwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1 (1936); Drexel\nFurniture, 259 U. S. 20. More often and more recently\nwe have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive\nor effect of revenue-raising measures. See Kahriger, 345\nU. S., at 27\u201331 (collecting cases). We have nonetheless\nmaintained that \u201c \u2018there comes a time in the extension of\nthe penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses\nits character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the\ncharacteristics of regulation and punishment.\u2019 \u201d Kurth\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 779 (quoting Drexel Furniture, supra,\nat 38).\n   We have already explained that the shared responsibil-\nity payment\u2019s practical characteristics pass muster as a\ntax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing\npower. Supra, at 35\u201336. Because the tax at hand is\nwithin even those strict limits, we need not here decide the\nprecise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive\nthat the taxing power does not authorize it. It remains\ntrue, however, that the \u201c \u2018power to tax is not the power to\ndestroy while this Court sits.\u2019 \u201d Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v.\nTexas Co., 336 U. S. 342, 364 (1949) (quoting Panhandle\nOil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223\n(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting)).\n   Third, although the breadth of Congress\u2019s power to tax\nis greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing\npower does not give Congress the same degree of control\nover individual behavior. Once we recognize that Con-\ngress may regulate a particular decision under the Com-\nmerce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full\nweight to bear. Congress may simply command individ-\nuals to do as it directs. An individual who disobeys may\nbe subjected to criminal sanctions. Those sanctions can\ninclude not only fines and imprisonment, but all the at-\ntendant consequences of being branded a criminal: depri-\nvation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right\nto bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment op-\nportunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other\ncontroversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.\n   By contrast, Congress\u2019s authority under the taxing\npower is limited to requiring an individual to pay money\ninto the Federal Treasury, no more. If a tax is properly\npaid, the Government has no power to compel or punish\nindividuals subject to it. We do not make light of the se-\nvere burden that taxation\u2014especially taxation motivated\nby a regulatory purpose\u2014can impose. But imposition\n44         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful\nchoice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing\nto pay a tax levied on that choice.11\n  The Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that certain in-\ndividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health\ninsurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Be-\ncause the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role\nto forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.\n                               D\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG questions the necessity of rejecting\nthe Government\u2019s commerce power argument, given that\n\u00a75000A can be upheld under the taxing power. Post, at 37.\nBut the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy\ninsurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a com-\nmand if the Constitution allowed it. It is only because the\nCommerce Clause does not authorize such a command\nthat it is necessary to reach the taxing power question.\nAnd it is only because we have a duty to construe a stat-\nute to save it, if fairly possible, that \u00a75000A can be inter-\npreted as a tax. Without deciding the Commerce Clause\nquestion, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving\nconstruction.\n  The Federal Government does not have the power to\norder people to buy health insurance. Section 5000A\nwould therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command.\nThe Federal Government does have the power to impose a\ntax on those without health insurance. Section 5000A is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Of course, individuals do not have a lawful choice not to pay a tax\n\ndue, and may sometimes face prosecution for failing to do so (although\nnot for declining to make the shared responsibility payment, see 26\nU. S. C. \u00a75000A(g)(2)). But that does not show that the tax restricts the\nlawful choice whether to undertake or forgo the activity on which the tax\nis predicated. Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully\nforgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance\nand pay lower taxes. The only thing they may not lawfully do is not\nbuy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The States also enjoy\nconsiderable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels\nfor parents of needy families. \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)(ii).

We have\nlong recognized that Congress may use this power to grant\nfederal funds to the States, and may condition such a\ngrant upon the States\u2019 \u201ctaking certain actions that Con-\ngress could not require them to take.\u201d College Savings Bank,\n527 U. S., at 686. Such measures \u201cencourage a State\nto regulate in a particular way, [and] influenc[e] a State\u2019s\npolicy choices.\u201d New York, supra, at 166. The con-\nditions imposed by Congress ensure that the funds are\nused by the States to \u201cprovide for the . . . general Welfare\u201d\nin the manner Congress intended.\n   At the same time, our cases have recognized limits on\nCongress\u2019s power under the Spending Clause to secure\nstate compliance with federal objectives. \u201cWe have re-\npeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as\n\u2018much in the nature of a contract.\u2019 \u201d Barnes v. Gorman,\n536 U. S. 181, 186 (2002) (quoting Pennhurst State School\nand Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981)). The\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          47\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nlegitimacy of Congress\u2019s exercise of the spending power\n\u201cthus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly\naccepts the terms of the \u2018contract.\u2019 \u201d Pennhurst, supra,\nat 17. Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring\nthat Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the\nstatus of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed-\neral system. That system \u201crests on what might at first\nseem a counterintuitive insight, that \u2018freedom is enhanced\nby the creation of two governments, not one.\u2019 \u201d Bond, 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Alden v. Maine, 527\nU. S. 706, 758 (1999)). For this reason, \u201cthe Constitution\nhas never been understood to confer upon Congress the\nability to require the States to govern according to Con-\ngress\u2019 instructions.\u201d New York, supra, at 162. Otherwise\nthe two-government system established by the Framers\nwould give way to a system that vests power in one central\ngovernment, and individual liberty would suffer.\n   That insight has led this Court to strike down fed-\neral legislation that commandeers a State\u2019s legislative or\nadministrative apparatus for federal purposes. See, e.g.,\nPrintz, 521 U. S., at 933 (striking down federal legisla-\ntion compelling state law enforcement officers to perform\nfederally mandated background checks on handgun pur-\nchasers); New York, supra, at 174\u2013175 (invalidating provi-\nsions of an Act that would compel a State to either take\ntitle to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste\nregulations). It has also led us to scrutinize Spending\nClause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using\nfinancial inducements to exert a \u201cpower akin to undue\ninfluence.\u201d Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548,\n590 (1937). Congress may use its spending power to cre-\nate incentives for States to act in accordance with federal\npolicies. But when \u201cpressure turns into compulsion,\u201d ibid.,\nthe legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\n\u201c[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the\nauthority to require the States to regulate.\u201d New York,\n48       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n505 U. S., at 178. That is true whether Congress directly\ncommands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State\nto adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.\n   Permitting the Federal Government to force the States\nto implement a federal program would threaten the politi-\ncal accountability key to our federal system. \u201c[W]here the\nFederal Government directs the States to regulate, it may\nbe state officials who will bear the brunt of public disap-\nproval, while the federal officials who devised the regu-\nlatory program may remain insulated from the electoral\nramifications of their decision.\u201d Id., at 169. Spending\nClause programs do not pose this danger when a State has\na legitimate choice whether to accept the federal condi-\ntions in exchange for federal funds. In such a situation,\nstate officials can fairly be held politically accountable for\nchoosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when\nthe State has no choice, the Federal Government can\nachieve its objectives without accountability, just as in\nNew York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened\nwhen Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because\nCongress can use that power to implement federal policy it\ncould not impose directly under its enumerated powers.\n   We addressed such concerns in Steward Machine. That\ncase involved a federal tax on employers that was abated\nif the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that\nmet certain federally specified conditions. An employer\nsued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly \u201cdriv[ing]\nthe state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure\ninto the enactment of unemployment compensation laws\nat the bidding of the central government.\u201d 301 U. S., at\n587. We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Gov-\nernment might employ its taxing power to exert a \u201cpower\nakin to undue influence\u201d upon the States. Id., at 590. But\nwe observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and\nabatement program to channel money to the States that\nwould otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          49\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nuse in providing national unemployment services. Con-\ngress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the\nmoney into state programs only on the condition that the\nmoney be used for the same purposes. Predicating tax\nabatement on a State\u2019s adoption of a particular type of un-\nemployment legislation was therefore a means to \u201csafe-\nguard [the Federal Government\u2019s] own treasury.\u201d Id., at\n591. We held that \u201c[i]n such circumstances, if in no oth-\ners, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the\nbounds of power.\u201d Ibid.\n   In rejecting the argument that the federal law was a\n\u201cweapon[ ] of coercion, destroying or impairing the auton-\nomy of the states,\u201d the Court noted that there was no\nreason to suppose that the State in that case acted other\nthan through \u201cher unfettered will.\u201d Id., at 586, 590.\nIndeed, the State itself did \u201cnot offer a suggestion that in\npassing the unemployment law she was affected by du-\nress.\u201d Id., at 589.\n   As our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress\nmay attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and\nspending programs to preserve its control over the use of\nfederal funds. In the typical case we look to the States to\ndefend their prerogatives by adopting \u201cthe simple expedi-\nent of not yielding\u201d to federal blandishments when they\ndo not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.\nMassachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 482 (1923). The\nStates are separate and independent sovereigns. Some-\ntimes they have to act like it.\n   The States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion\nis far from the typical case. They object that Congress has\n\u201ccrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from\ncoercion,\u201d New York, supra, at 175, in the way it has struc-\ntured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the\nnew funds to States that will not accept the new condi-\ntions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those\nStates\u2019 existing Medicaid funds. The States claim that\n50       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthis threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling\nStates to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care\ncoverage effected by the Act.\n   Given the nature of the threat and the programs at\nissue here, we must agree. We have upheld Congress\u2019s\nauthority to condition the receipt of funds on the States\u2019\ncomplying with restrictions on the use of those funds,\nbecause that is the means by which Congress ensures that\nthe funds are spent according to its view of the \u201cgeneral\nWelfare.\u201d Conditions that do not here govern the use\nof the funds, however, cannot be justified on that ba-\nsis. When, for example, such conditions take the form of\nthreats to terminate other significant independent grants,\nthe conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressur-\ning the States to accept policy changes.\n   In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered a challenge to a\nfederal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a\nState\u2019s federal highway funds if the State did not raise its\ndrinking age to 21. The Court found that the condition\nwas \u201cdirectly related to one of the main purposes for which\nhighway funds are expended\u2014safe interstate travel.\u201d 483\nU. S., at 208. At the same time, the condition was not a\nrestriction on how the highway funds\u2014set aside for spec-\nific highway improvement and maintenance efforts\u2014were\nto be used.\n   We accordingly asked whether \u201cthe financial induce-\nment offered by Congress\u201d was \u201cso coercive as to pass the\npoint at which \u2018pressure turns into compulsion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n211 (quoting Steward Machine, supra, at 590). By \u201cfinan-\ncial inducement\u201d the Court meant the threat of losing five\npercent of highway funds; no new money was offered to\nthe States to raise their drinking ages. We found that the\ninducement was not impermissibly coercive, because\nCongress was offering only \u201crelatively mild encouragement\nto the States.\u201d Dole, 483 U. S., at 211. We observed that\n\u201call South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          51\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncourse as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%\u201d of\nher highway funds. Ibid. In fact, the federal funds at\nstake constituted less than half of one percent of South\nDakota\u2019s budget at the time. See Nat. Assn. of State\nBudget Officers, The State Expenditure Report 59 (1987);\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 791 F. 2d 628, 630 (CA8 1986). In\nconsequence, \u201cwe conclude[d] that [the] encouragement\nto state action [was] a valid use of the spending power.\u201d\nDole, 483 U. S., at 212. Whether to accept the drinking\nage change \u201cremain[ed] the prerogative of the States not\nmerely in theory but in fact.\u201d Id., at 211\u2013212.\n   In this case, the financial \u201cinducement\u201d Congress has\nchosen is much more than \u201crelatively mild encourage-\nment\u201d\u2014it is a gun to the head. Section 1396c of the Medi-\ncaid Act provides that if a State\u2019s Medicaid plan does\nnot comply with the Act\u2019s requirements, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services may declare that \u201cfurther\npayments will not be made to the State.\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71396c. A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s\nexpansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not\nmerely \u201ca relatively small percentage\u201d of its existing Medi-\ncaid funding, but all of it. Dole, supra, at 211. Medicaid\nspending accounts for over 20 percent of the average\nState\u2019s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83\npercent of those costs. See Nat. Assn. of State Budget\nOfficers, Fiscal Year 2010 State Expenditure Report, p. 11,\nTable 5 (2011); 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(b). The Federal Gov-\nernment estimates that it will pay out approximately $3.3\ntrillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs\nof pre-expansion Medicaid. Brief for United States 10,\nn. 6. In addition, the States have developed intricate\nstatutory and administrative regimes over the course of\nmany decades to implement their objectives under existing\nMedicaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could con-\nclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one\npercent of South Dakota\u2019s budget left that State with a\n52         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n\u201cprerogative\u201d to reject Congress\u2019s desired policy, \u201cnot\nmerely in theory but in fact.\u201d 483 U. S., at 211\u2013212. The\nthreatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\u2019s overall\nbudget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the\nStates with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid\nexpansion.12\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that Dole is distinguishable\nbecause here \u201cCongress has not threatened to withhold\nfunds earmarked for any other program.\u201d Post, at 47. But\nthat begs the question: The States contend that the ex-\npansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is\nforcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the\nexisting Medicaid program. We cannot agree that existing\nMedicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable\nCare Act are all one program simply because \u201cCongress\nstyled\u201d them as such. Post, at 49. If the expansion is not\nproperly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid\nprogram, Congress\u2019s decision to so title it is irrelevant.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 JUSTICE  GINSBURG observes that state Medicaid spending will in-\ncrease by only 0.8 percent after the expansion. Post, at 43. That not\nonly ignores increased state administrative expenses, but also assumes\nthat the Federal Government will continue to fund the expansion at the\ncurrent statutorily specified levels. It is not unheard of, however, for\nthe Federal Government to increase requirements in such a manner as\nto impose unfunded mandates on the States. More importantly, the\nsize of the new financial burden imposed on a State is irrelevant in\nanalyzing whether the State has been coerced into accepting that\nburden. \u201cYour money or your life\u201d is a coercive proposition, whether\nyou have a single dollar in your pocket or $500.\n  13 Nor, of course, can the number of pages the amendment occu-\n\npies, or the extent to which the change preserves and works within\nthe existing program, be dispositive. Cf. post, at 49\u201350 (opinion of\nGINSBURG, J.). Take, for example, the following hypothetical amend-\nment: \u201cAll of a State\u2019s citizens are now eligible for Medicaid.\u201d That\nchange would take up a single line and would not alter any \u201coperational\naspect[ ] of the program\u201d beyond the eligibility requirements. Post, at\n49. Yet it could hardly be argued that such an amendment was a\npermissible modification of Medicaid, rather than an attempt to foist an\nentirely new health care system upon the States.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          53\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   Here, the Government claims that the Medicaid expan-\nsion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the ex-\nisting program because the States agreed that Congress\ncould change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on\nin the first place. The Government observes that the\nSocial Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid\nprovisions, contains a clause expressly reserving \u201c[t]he\nright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u201d of that\nstatute. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304. So it does. But \u201cif Congress\nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal mon-\neys, it must do so unambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst, 451 U. S.,\nat 17. A State confronted with statutory language reserv-\ning the right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the pertinent provisions\nof the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that\nCongress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medi-\ncaid program as it developed. Congress has in fact done\nso, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other\ntimes both old and new. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-\nments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1381\u20131382, 1465 (extending Med-\nicaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new\nfunding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,\n\u00a74601, 104 Stat. 1388\u2013166 (extending eligibility, and\nconditioning old and new funds).\n   The Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift\nin kind, not merely degree. The original program was de-\nsigned to cover medical services for four particular cat-\negories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly,\nand needy families with dependent children. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10). Previous amendments to Medicaid\neligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of\nthese categories. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid\nis transformed into a program to meet the health care\nneeds of the entire nonelderly population with income\nbelow 133 percent of the poverty level. It is no longer a\nprogram to care for the neediest among us, but rather an\nelement of a comprehensive national plan to provide uni-\n54         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nversal health insurance coverage.14\n   Indeed, the manner in which the expansion is struc-\ntured indicates that while Congress may have styled the\nexpansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recog-\nnized it was enlisting the States in a new health care\nprogram. Congress created a separate funding provision\nto cover the costs of providing services to any person\nmade newly eligible by the expansion. While Congress pays\n50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals cur-\nrently enrolled in Medicaid, \u00a71396d(b), once the expansion is\nfully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the\ncosts for newly eligible persons, \u00a71396d(y)(1). The condi-\ntions on use of the different funds are also distinct. Con-\ngress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level\nof coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional\nMedicaid benefit package. \u00a71396a(k)(1); see Brief for\nUnited States 9.\n   As we have explained, \u201c[t]hough Congress\u2019 power to\nlegislate under the spending power is broad, it does not\ninclude surprising participating States with postac-\nceptance or \u2018retroactive\u2019 conditions.\u201d Pennhurst, supra, at\n25. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress\u2019s reser-\nvation of the right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the Medicaid\nprogram included the power to transform it so dramatically.\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that in fact this expansion is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that the States can have no objection to\n\nthe Medicaid expansion, because \u201cCongress could have repealed Medi-\ncaid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new\nprogram combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage\nrequired by the ACA.\u201d Post, at 51; see also post, at 38. But it would\ncertainly not be that easy. Practical constraints would plainly inhibit,\nif not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing\nprogram and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political\nreconsideration. Such a massive undertaking would hardly be \u201critual-\nistic.\u201d Ibid. The same is true of JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s suggestion that\nCongress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.\nPost, at 44.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           55\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nno different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such\nthat \u201ca State would be hard put to complain that it lacked\nfair notice.\u201d Post, at 56. But the prior change she dis-\ncusses\u2014presumably the most dramatic alteration she could\nfind\u2014does not come close to working the transformation\nthe expansion accomplishes. She highlights an amend-\nment requiring States to cover pregnant women and in-\ncreasing the number of eligible children. Ibid. But this\nmodification can hardly be described as a major change in\na program that\u2014from its inception\u2014provided health care\nfor \u201cfamilies with dependent children.\u201d Previous Medicaid\namendments simply do not fall into the same category as\nthe one at stake here.\n   The Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to \u201cfix\nthe outermost line\u201d where persuasion gives way to coer-\ncion. 301 U. S., at 591. The Court found it \u201c[e]nough for\npresent purposes that wherever the line may be, this\nstatute is within it.\u201d Ibid. We have no need to fix a line\neither. It is enough for today that wherever that line may\nbe, this statute is surely beyond it. Congress may not\nsimply \u201cconscript state [agencies] into the national bu-\nreaucratic army,\u201d FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775\n(1982) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part), and that is what it is attempting to do\nwith the Medicaid expansion.\n                              B\n  Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering\nfunds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availa-\nbility of health care, and requiring that States accepting\nsuch funds comply with the conditions on their use. What\nCongress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose\nnot to participate in that new program by taking away\ntheir existing Medicaid funding. Section 1396c gives the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to\n56       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ndo just that. It allows her to withhold all \u201cfurther [Medi-\ncaid] payments . . . to the State\u201d if she determines that the\nState is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement,\nincluding those contained in the expansion. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71396c. In light of the Court\u2019s holding, the Secretary\ncannot apply \u00a71396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds\nfor failure to comply with the requirements set out in the\nexpansion.\n   That fully remedies the constitutional violation we have\nidentified. The chapter of the United States Code that\ncontains \u00a71396c includes a severability clause confirming\nthat we need go no further. That clause specifies that \u201c[i]f\nany provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to\nany person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder\nof the chapter, and the application of such provision to\nother persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\u201d\n\u00a71303. Today\u2019s holding does not affect the continued ap-\nplication of \u00a71396c to the existing Medicaid program. Nor\ndoes it affect the Secretary\u2019s ability to withdraw funds pro-\nvided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has\nchosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with\nthe requirements of that Act.\n   This is not to say, as the joint dissent suggests, that we\nare \u201crewriting the Medicaid Expansion.\u201d Post, at 48.\nInstead, we determine, first, that \u00a71396c is unconstitu-\ntional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds\nfrom States that decline to comply with the expansion.\nWe then follow Congress\u2019s explicit textual instruction to\nleave unaffected \u201cthe remainder of the chapter, and the\napplication of [the challenged] provision to other persons\nor circumstances.\u201d \u00a71303. When we invalidate an applica-\ntion of a statute because that application is unconstitu-\ntional, we are not \u201crewriting\u201d the statute; we are merely\nenforcing the Constitution.\n   The question remains whether today\u2019s holding affects\nother provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In considering\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           57\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthat question, \u201c[w]e seek to determine what Congress\nwould have intended in light of the Court\u2019s constitutional\nholding.\u201d United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 246\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our \u201ctouch-\nstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent,\nfor a court cannot use its remedial powers to circum-\nvent the intent of the legislature.\u201d Ayotte v. Planned\nParenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330\n(2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question\nhere is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of\nthe Act to stand, had it known that States would have a\ngenuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid\nexpansion. Unless it is \u201cevident\u201d that the answer is no, we\nmust leave the rest of the Act intact. Champlin Refining\nCo. v. Corporation Comm\u2019n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234\n(1932).\n  We are confident that Congress would have wanted to\npreserve the rest of the Act. It is fair to say that Congress\nassumed that every State would participate in the Medi-\ncaid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to\ndo so. The States contend that Congress enacted the rest\nof the Act with such full participation in mind; they point\nout that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying\nthe mandate, 26 U. S.

The individual mandate cannot\nbe upheld as an exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the\nCommerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to\nregulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to\nengage in it. In this case, however, it is reasonable to con-\nstrue what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those\nwho have a certain amount of income, but choose to go\nwithout health insurance. Such legislation is within Con-\ngress\u2019s power to tax.\n  As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Af-\nfordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening\nexisting Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to\norder the States to regulate according to its instructions.\nCongress may offer the States grants and require the\nStates to comply with accompanying conditions, but the\nStates must have a genuine choice whether to accept the\noffer. The States are given no such choice in this case:\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                 59\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

I would also hold\nthat the Spending Clause permits the Medicaid expansion\nexactly as Congress enacted it.\n                             I\n   The provision of health care is today a concern of na\u00ad\ntional dimension, just as the provision of old-age and\nsurvivors\u2019 benefits was in the 1930\u2019s. In the Social Secu-\nrity Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide\nmonthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually,\nto their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have\nadopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose,\ninstead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and\nstate governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the\nCommerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This\nrigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is\nstunningly retrogressive.\n   Since 1937, our precedent has recognized Congress\u2019\nlarge authority to set the Nation\u2019s course in the economic\nand social welfare realm. See United States v. Darby, 312\nU. S. 100, 115 (1941) (overruling Hammer v. Dagenhart,\n247 U. S. 251 (1918), and recognizing that \u201cregulations of\ncommerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibi-\ntion are within the plenary power conferred on Congress\nby the Commerce Clause\u201d); NLRB v.

THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s crabbed reading of the Commerce Clause\nharks back to the era in which the Court routinely thwarted\nCongress\u2019 efforts to regulate the national economy in\nthe interest of those who labor to sustain it. See, e.g.,\nRailroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330,\n362, 368 (1935) (invalidating compulsory retirement and\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

It is a reading\nthat should not have staying power.\n                             A\n   In enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (ACA), Congress comprehensively reformed the\nnational market for health-care products and services.\nBy any measure, that market is immense. Collectively,\nAmericans spent $2.5 trillion on health care in 2009,\naccounting for 17.6% of our Nation\u2019s economy. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718091(2)(B) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Within the next decade,\nit is anticipated, spending on health care will nearly dou\u00ad\nble. Ibid.\n   The health-care market\u2019s size is not its only distinctive\nfeature. Unlike the market for almost any other product\nor service, the market for medical care is one in which all\nindividuals inevitably participate. Virtually every person\nresiding in the United States, sooner or later, will visit\na doctor or other health-care professional. See Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, National Center for Health\nStatistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults:\nNational Health Interview Survey 2009, Ser. 10, No. 249,\np. 124, Table 37 (Dec. 2010) (Over 99.5% of adults above\n65 have visited a health-care professional.). Most people\nwill do so repeatedly. See id., at 115, Table 34 (In 2009\nalone, 64% of adults made two or more visits to a doctor\u2019s\noffice.).\n   When individuals make those visits, they face another\nreality of the current market for medical care: its high\ncost. In 2010, on average, an individual in the United\nStates incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses.\nDept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medi\u00ad\ncare and Medicaid Services, Historic National Health\n4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

See\nAlemayahu & Warner, The Lifetime Distribution of\nHealth Care Costs, in 39 Health Service Research 627, 635\n(June 2004). When a person requires nonroutine care, the\ncost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.\nA single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs up\u00ad\nwards of $10,000. See Dept. of Health and Human Ser\u00ad\nvices, Office of Health Policy, ASPE Research Brief: The\nValue of Health Insurance 5 (May 2011). Treatments for\nmany serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly\ncost a substantial sum.

S. domiciliary will incur significant\nmedical expenses during his or her lifetime, the time when\ncare will be needed is often unpredictable. An accident, a\nheart attack, or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs with\u00ad\nout warning. Inescapably, we are all at peril of needing\nmedical care without a moment\u2019s notice.

See Con\u00ad\ngressional Budget Office, CBO\u2019s 2011 Long-Term Budget\nOutlook 37 (June 2011).\n   Not all U. S. residents, however, have health insurance.\nIn 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured,\neither by choice or, more likely, because they could not\nafford private insurance and did not qualify for govern\u00ad\nment aid. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, C.\nDeNavas-Walt, B. Proctor, & J. Smith, Income, Poverty,\nand Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009,\np. 23, Table 8 (Sept. 2010).

Over 60% of those without insurance\nvisit a doctor\u2019s office or emergency room in a given year.\nSee Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics, Health\u2014United States\u20142010,\np. 282, Table 79 (Feb. 2011).\n                              B\n  The large number of individuals without health insur\u00ad\nance, Congress found, heavily burdens the national\nhealth-care market. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2). As just\nnoted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a seri\u00ad\nous illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford\nto pay on her own. Unlike markets for most products,\nhowever, the inability to pay for care does not mean that\nan uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and\nstate law, as well as professional obligations and embed\u00ad\nded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to\nprovide care when it is most needed, regardless of the\npatient\u2019s ability to pay. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395dd; Fla.\nStat. \u00a7395.1041(3)(f) (2010); Tex. Health & Safety Code\n6        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

In 2008, for example, hospi-\ntals, physicians, and other health-care professionals\nreceived no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116\nbillion in care they administered to those without insur\u00ad\nance. 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\n   Health-care providers do not absorb these bad debts.\nInstead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost\nof uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the\ngovernment and private insurance companies. In response,\nprivate insurers increase their premiums, shifting the\ncost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who\ncarry insurance. The net result: Those with health insur\u00ad\nance subsidize the medical care of those without it. As\neconomists would describe what happens, the uninsured\n\u201cfree ride\u201d on those who pay for health insurance.\n   The size of this subsidy is considerable. Congress found\nthat the cost-shifting just described \u201cincreases family\n[insurance] premiums by on average over $1,000 a year.\u201d\nIbid. Higher premiums, in turn, render health insurance\nless affordable, forcing more people to go without insur\u00ad\nance and leading to further cost-shifting.\n   And it is hardly just the currently sick or injured among\nthe uninsured who prompt elevation of the price of health\ncare and health insurance. Insurance companies and\nhealth-care providers know that some percentage of\nhealthy, uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury\neach year and will receive medical care despite their ina\u00ad\nbility to pay. In anticipation of this uncompensated care,\nhealth-care companies raise their prices, and insurers\ntheir premiums. In other words, because any uninsured\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Because\nthose without insurance generally lack access to preventa\u00ad\ntive care, they do not receive treatment for conditions\u2014\nlike hypertension and diabetes\u2014that can be successfully\nand affordably treated if diagnosed early on. See Institute\nof Medicine, National Academies, Insuring America\u2019s\nHealth: Principles and Recommendations 43 (2004).

Id., at 43\u201344. The extra time and resources provid\u00ad\ners spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers\u2019\nability to care for those who do have insurance. See Kliff,\nHigh Uninsured Rates Can Kill You\u2014Even if You Have\nCoverage, Washington Post (May 7, 2012) (describing a\nstudy of California\u2019s health-care market which found\nthat, when hospitals divert time and resources to provide\nuncompensated care, the quality of care the hospitals\ndeliver to those with insurance drops significantly), availa-\nble at http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/\nhigh-uninsured-rates-can-kill-you-even-if-you-have-coverage/2012/\n05/07/gIQALNHN8T_print.html.\n                           C\n  States cannot resolve the problem of the uninsured on\ntheir own.

An influx of unhealthy individuals\ninto a State with universal health care would result in\nincreased spending on medical services. To cover the\nincreased costs, a State would have to raise taxes, and\nprivate health-insurance companies would have to in\u00ad\ncrease premiums. Higher taxes and increased insurance\ncosts would, in turn, encourage businesses and healthy\nindividuals to leave the State.\n  States that undertake health-care reforms on their own\nthus risk \u201cplacing themselves in a position of economic\ndisadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors.\u201d\nDavis, 301 U.

See\n26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (the minimum\ncoverage provision). As explained below, by employing\nthese tools, Congress was able to achieve a practical, alto\u00ad\ngether reasonable, solution.\n  A central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of\nuninsured U. S. residents. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(C)\nand (I) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The minimum coverage\nprovision advances this objective by giving potential recip\u00ad\nients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insur\u00ad\nance. Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual\nmust either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a\ntax penalty. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A.\n  The minimum coverage provision serves a further pur\u00ad\npose vital to Congress\u2019 plan to reduce the number of unin\u00ad\nsured. Congress knew that encouraging individuals to\npurchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem,\nbecause most of the uninsured are not uninsured by\nchoice.1 Of particular concern to Congress were people\nwho, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot\nacquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical\nconditions.\n  Before the ACA\u2019s enactment, private insurance compa\u00ad\nnies took an applicant\u2019s medical history into account when\nsetting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an\nindividual.

SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nical conditions cost insurance companies significantly more\nthan those without such conditions, insurers routinely re-\nfused to insure these individuals, charged them substan\u00ad\ntially higher premiums, or offered only limited coverage\nthat did not include the preexisting illness. See Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, Coverage Denied: How the\nCurrent Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind\n1 (2009) (Over the past three years, 12.6 million non\u00ad\nelderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged\nhigher premiums due to a preexisting condition.).\n   To ensure that individuals with medical histories have\naccess to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three\u00ad\npart solution. First, Congress imposed a \u201cguaranteed is\u00ad\nsue\u201d requirement, which bars insurers from denying\ncoverage to any person on account of that person\u2019s medical\ncondition or history. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7300gg\u20131, 300gg\u20133,\n300gg\u20134(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Second, Congress required\ninsurers to use \u201ccommunity rating\u201d to price their insurance\npolicies. See \u00a7300gg. Community rating, in effect, bars\ninsurance companies from charging higher premiums\nto those with preexisting conditions.\n   But these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could\nnot work effectively unless individuals were given a pow\u00ad\nerful incentive to obtain insurance.

In answering these\nquestions, we presume the statute under review is consti\u00ad\ntutional and may strike it down only on a \u201cplain showing\u201d\nthat Congress acted irrationally. United States v. Morri-\nson, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000).\n                               C\n  Straightforward application of these principles would\nrequire the Court to hold that the minimum coverage\nprovision is proper Commerce Clause legislation. Beyond\ndispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that\nthe uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate\ncommerce. Those without insurance consume billions of\ndollars of health-care products and services each year. See\nsupra, at 5. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered\nlargely by national and regional companies who routinely\ntransact business across state lines. The uninsured also\ncross state lines to receive care. Some have medical emer\u00ad\ngencies while away from home. Others, when sick, go to a\nneighboring State that provides better care for those who\nhave not prepaid for care. See supra, at 7\u20138.\n  Not only do those without insurance consume a large\namount of health care each year; critically, as earlier\nexplained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of\nthat consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on\nother consumers, and reduces market efficiency and sta\u00ad\nbility. See supra, at 5\u20137. Given these far-reaching effects\non interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is\nhardly inconsequential or equivalent to \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d\nante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nhas the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.\nSee supra, at 14\u201316. See also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128\n(\u201cIt is well established by decisions of this Court that\nthe power to regulate commerce includes the power to regu\u00ad\nlate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are\ndealt in and practices affecting such prices.\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   The minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a\n\u201creasonable connection\u201d to Congress\u2019 goal of protecting the\nhealth-care market from the disruption caused by individ\u00ad\nuals who fail to obtain insurance. By requiring those who\ndo not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum cover\u00ad\nage provision gives individuals a strong incentive to in\u00ad\nsure. This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe,\nwould reduce the number of uninsured and, correspond\u00ad\ningly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on\nthe national health-care market.\n   Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured\nindividuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain\ninsurance or to pay the specified penalty. As earlier ob\u00ad\nserved, because every person is at risk of needing care at\nany moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of\ntheir current health status, adversely affect the price of\nhealth care and health insurance. See supra, at 6\u20137.\nMoreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to\nthose in need of immediate care simply could not work.\nInsurance companies would either charge these individu\u00ad\nals prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community\u00ad\nrating regulations were in place, close up shop.

The commerce power does\nnot, THE CHIEF JUSTICE announces, permit Congress\nto \u201ccompe[l] individuals to become active in commerce\nby purchasing a product.\u201d Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).\n                             1\n                             a\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s novel constraint on Congress\u2019\ncommerce power gains no force from our precedent and for\nthat reason alone warrants disapprobation. See infra, at\n23\u201327. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress\nlacks authority under the Commerce Clause to \u201ccompel\nindividuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an\nunwanted product,\u201d ante, at 18, such a limitation would be\ninapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume\nhealth-care products and services. See supra, at 3. Thus,\nif THE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct that an insurance\u00ad\npurchase requirement can be applied only to those who\n\u201cactively\u201d consume health care, the minimum coverage\nprovision fits the bill.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not dispute that all U. S. resi\u00ad\ndents participate in the market for health services over\nthe course of their lives. See ante, at 16 (\u201cEveryone will\neventually need health care at a time and to an extent\nthey cannot predict.\u201d). But, THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists,\nthe uninsured cannot be considered active in the market\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

First, more than\n60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor\u2019s\noffice each year. See supra, at 5. Nearly 90% will within\nfive years.4 An uninsured\u2019s consumption of health care is\nthus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the\nnext five years and more likely than not to occur this year.\n   Equally evident, Congress has no way of separating\nthose uninsured individuals who will need emergency medi-\ncal care today (surely their consumption of medical care\nis sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need\nmedical services for years to come. No one knows when an\nemergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the unin\u00ad\nsured arise daily. To capture individuals who unexpect-\nedly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then,\nCongress needed to include individuals who will not go to\na doctor anytime soon. Congress, our decisions instruct,\nhas authority to cast its net that wide. See Perez v. United\nStates, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971) (\u201c[W]hen it is necessary\nin order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more\nthan the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.\u201d (in\u00ad\nternal quotation marks omitted)).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for\n\nHealth Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U.

This criticism\nignores the reality that a healthy young person may be a day away\nfrom needing health care. See supra, at 4. A victim of an accident or\nunforeseen illness will consume extensive medical care immediately,\nthough scarcely expecting to do so.\n20       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\n   Second, it is Congress\u2019 role, not the Court\u2019s, to delineate\nthe boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to\nregulate. THE CHIEF JUSTICE defines the health-care mar-\nket as including only those transactions that will occur\neither in the next instant or within some (unspecified)\nproximity to the next instant. But Congress could reason\u00ad\nably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective,\nencompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur\nover the next decade, see supra, at 19, not just those oc\u00ad\ncurring here and now.\n   Third, contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s contention, our\nprecedent does indeed support \u201c[t]he proposition that\nCongress may dictate the conduct of an individual today\nbecause of prophesied future activity.\u201d Ante, at 26. In\nWickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Govern\u00ad\nment imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he\nwas permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment\nAct of 1938 (AAA). 317 U. S., at 114\u2013115. He could not\nbe penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the\nwheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open\nmarket. Id., at 119. The Court rejected this argument.\nId., at 127\u2013129. Wheat intended for home consumption,\nthe Court noted, \u201coverhangs the market, and if induced by\nrising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price\nincreases [intended by the AAA].\u201d Id., at 128.\n   Similar reasoning supported the Court\u2019s judgment in\nRaich, which upheld Congress\u2019 authority to regulate mari\u00ad\njuana grown for personal use. 545 U. S., at 19. Home\u00ad\ngrown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar-\nket for marijuana, we observed, for \u201cthe high demand in\nthe interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana\ninto that market.\u201d Ibid.\n   Our decisions thus acknowledge Congress\u2019 authority,\nunder the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an\nindividual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from\ngrowing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Congress\u2019 actions\nare even more rational in this case, where the future\nactivity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to\noccur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will\ntake place.\n   Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the\nhealth-care market, THE CHIEF JUSTICE draws an analogy\nto the car market. An individual \u201cis not \u2018active in the car\nmarket,\u2019 \u201d THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, simply because he\nor she may someday buy a car. Ante, at 25. The analogy\nis inapt. The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medi\u00ad\ncal care and the guarantee that emergency care will be\nprovided when required are conditions nonexistent in\nother markets. That is so of the market for cars, and of\nthe market for broccoli as well. Although an individual\nmight buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no\ncertainty she will ever do so. And if she eventually wants\na car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to\npay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nour\u00ad\nishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense\nof another consumer forced to pay an inflated price. See\nThomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F. 3d 529, 565\n(CA6 2011) (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (\u201cRegulating\nhow citizens pay for what they already receive (health\ncare), never quite know when they will need, and in the\ncase of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not\nbe able to afford, has few (if any) parallels in modern\nlife.\u201d). Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the\nground that all are participants or will be participants in\nthe health-care market would therefore carry no implica\u00ad\ntion that Congress may justify under the Commerce\nClause a mandate to buy other products and services.\n   Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage\nprovision \u201ccompel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an un\u00ad\n22       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

If unwanted today, medical service secured by\ninsurance may be desperately needed tomorrow. Virtually\neveryone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point\nin his or her life. See supra, at 3. Health insurance is a\nmeans of paying for this care, nothing more. In requiring\nindividuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not\nmandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.\nRather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which\nindividuals pay for an interstate good they consume:\nPersons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical\ncare in advance (instead of at the point of service) and\nthrough insurance (instead of out of pocket). Establishing\npayment terms for goods in or affecting interstate com\u00ad\nmerce is quintessential economic regulation well within\nCongress\u2019 domain. See, e.g., United States v. Wrightwood\nDairy Co., 315 U. S. 110, 118 (1942). Cf. post, at 13 (joint\nopinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.)\n(recognizing that \u201cthe Federal Government can prescribe\n[a commodity\u2019s] quality . . . and even [its price]\u201d).\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE also calls the minimum coverage\nprovision an illegitimate effort to make young, healthy\nindividuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less\nhale and hardy. See ante, at 17, 25\u201326. This complaint,\ntoo, is spurious. Under the current health-care system,\nhealthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for\nwhich they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need\nit, emergency medical care will be available, although they\ncannot afford it. See supra, at 5\u20136. Those who have in\u00ad\nsurance bear the cost of this guarantee. See ibid. By\nrequiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or\npay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage\nprovision ends the free ride these individuals currently\nenjoy.\n   In the fullness of time, moreover, today\u2019s young and\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Viewed over\na lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who\npay more than their fair share currently will pay less than\ntheir fair share when they become senior citizens. And\neven if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals,\nover their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance\nthan they receive in health services, they have little to\ncomplain about, for that is how insurance works. Every\ninsured person receives protection against a catastrophic\nloss, even though only a subset of the covered class will\nultimately need that protection.\n                               b\n   In any event, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s limitation of the\ncommerce power to the regulation of those actively en\u00ad\ngaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Consti\u00ad\ntution or our decisions. Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution\ngrants Congress the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce . . .\namong the several States.\u201d Nothing in this language im-\nplies that Congress\u2019 commerce power is limited to regu-\nlating those actively engaged in commercial transactions.\nIndeed, as the D. C. Circuit observed, \u201c[a]t the time the\nConstitution was [framed], to \u2018regulate\u2019 meant,\u201d among\nother things, \u201cto require action.\u201d See Seven-Sky v. Holder,\n661 F. 3d 1, 16 (2011).\n   Arguing to the contrary, THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that\n\u201cthe Constitution gives Congress the power to \u2018coin\nMoney,\u2019 in addition to the power to \u2018regulate the Value\nthereof,\u2019 \u201d and similarly \u201cgives Congress the power to \u2018raise\nand support Armies\u2019 and to \u2018provide and maintain a Navy,\u2019 in\naddition to the power to \u2018make Rules for the Government\nand Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n18\u201319 (citing Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 5, 12\u201314). In separating the\npower to regulate from the power to bring the subject of\nthe regulation into existence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts,\n\u201c[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural\n24         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nunderstanding that the power to regulate assumes there is\nalready something to be regulated.\u201d Ante, at 19.\n   This argument is difficult to fathom. Requiring individ\u00ad\nuals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter\u00ad\nstate health-insurance and health-care markets, both of\nthem in existence well before the enactment of the ACA.\nSee Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (\u201cThe stimulation of com\u00ad\nmerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely\nas prohibitions or restrictions thereon.\u201d). Thus, the \u201csome\u00ad\nthing to be regulated\u201d was surely there when Congress\ncreated the minimum coverage provision.6\n   Nor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv\u00ad\nity line. In Wickard, for example, we upheld the penalty\nimposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat, even\nthough the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers\nto purchase wheat in the open market. Id., at 127\u2013129.\n\u201c[F]orcing some farmers into the market to buy what they\ncould provide for themselves\u201d was, the Court held, a valid\nmeans of regulating commerce. Id., at 128\u2013129. In an-\nother context, this Court similarly upheld Congress\u2019 author\u00ad\nity under the commerce power to compel an \u201cinactive\u201d land\u00ad\nholder to submit to an unwanted sale. See Monongahela\nNav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 335\u2013337 (1893)\n(\u201c[U]pon the [great] power to regulate commerce[,]\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress has the authority to mandate the sale of real prop-\nerty to the Government, where the sale is essential to the\nimprovement of a navigable waterway (emphasis added));\nCherokee Nation v.

The power\nto \u201cregulate the Value\u201d of the national currency presumably includes\nthe power to increase the currency\u2019s worth\u2014i.e., to create value where\nnone previously existed. And if the power to \u201c[r]egulat[e] . . . the land\nand naval Forces\u201d presupposes \u201cthere is already [in existence] some\u00ad\nthing to be regulated,\u201d i.e., an Army and a Navy, does Congress lack\nauthority to create an Air Force?\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Wickard,\n317 U. S., at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso supra, at 14\u201316. This Court\u2019s former endeavors to\nimpose categorical limits on the commerce power have not\nfared well. In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court\nattempted to cabin Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause authority\nby distinguishing \u201ccommerce\u201d from activity once conceived\nto be noncommercial, notably, \u201cproduction,\u201d \u201cmining,\u201d and\n\u201cmanufacturing.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight\nCo., 156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) (\u201cCommerce succeeds to manu\u00ad\nfacture, and is not a part of it.\u201d); Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,\n298 U. S. 238, 304 (1936) (\u201cMining brings the subject\nmatter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of\nit.\u201d). The Court also sought to distinguish activities hav\u00ad\ning a \u201cdirect\u201d effect on interstate commerce, and for that\nreason, subject to federal regulation, from those having\nonly an \u201cindirect\u201d effect, and therefore not amenable to\nfederal control. See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.\nv. United States, 295 U.

Failing to learn\nfrom this history, THE CHIEF JUSTICE plows ahead with\nhis formalistic distinction between those who are \u201cactive\nin commerce,\u201d ante, at 20, and those who are not.\n   It is not hard to show the difficulty courts (and Con\u00ad\ngress) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg\u00ad\nulate \u201cactivity\u201d from those that regulate \u201cinactivity.\u201d As\nJudge Easterbrook noted, \u201cit is possible to restate most\nactions as corresponding inactions with the same effect.\u201d\nArchie v. Racine, 847 F. 2d 1211, 1213 (CA7 1988) (en\nbanc). Take this case as an example. An individual who\nopts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can\nbe seen as actively selecting another form of insurance:\nself-insurance. See Thomas More Law Center, 651 F. 3d,\nat 561 (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (\u201cNo one is in\u00ad\nactive when deciding how to pay for health care, as self\u00ad\ninsurance and private insurance are two forms of action\nfor addressing the same risk.\u201d). The minimum coverage\nprovision could therefore be described as regulating activ\u00ad\nists in the self-insurance market.7 Wickard is another\nexample. Did the statute there at issue target activity\n(the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer\u2019s\nfailure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)? If any\u00ad\nthing, the Court\u2019s analysis suggested the latter. See 317\nU. S., at 127\u2013129.\n   At bottom, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s and the joint dissent\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s characterization of individuals who choose not\n\nto purchase private insurance as \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d ante, at 20, is simi\u00ad\nlarly questionable. A person who self-insures opts against prepayment for\na product the person will in time consume. When aggregated, exercise\nof that option has a substantial impact on the health-care market.

This concern is unfounded.\n   First, THE CHIEF JUSTICE could certainly uphold the\nindividual mandate without giving Congress carte blanche\nto enact any and all purchase mandates. As several times\nnoted, the unique attributes of the health-care market\nrender everyone active in that market and give rise to a\nsignificant free-riding problem that does not occur in other\nmarkets.

As an example of the type of regulation he\nfears, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites a Government mandate to\npurchase green vegetables. Ante, at 22\u201323. One could call\nthis concern \u201cthe broccoli horrible.\u201d Congress, THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning\nthat an individual\u2019s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the\nfailure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on\nothers. See ibid.\n   Consider the chain of inferences the Court would have\nto accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate\nwas likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care\ncosts borne by lithe Americans. The Court would have to\nbelieve that individuals forced to buy vegetables would\nthen eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away),\nwould prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed\nor raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods,\nand would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise\nor little sleep) to trump the improved diet.9 Such \u201cpil[ing\nof] inference upon inference\u201d is just what the Court re\u00ad\nfused to do in Lopez and Morrison.\n   Other provisions of the Constitution also check congres\u00ad\nsional overreaching. A mandate to purchase a particu-\nlar product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the\nedict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, inter\u00ad\nfered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a\nliberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The failure to purchase vegetables in THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s hypothet\u00ad\n\nical, then, is not what leads to higher health-care costs for others;\nrather, it is the failure of individuals to maintain a healthy diet, and\nthe resulting obesity, that creates the cost-shifting problem. See ante,\nat 22\u201323. Requiring individuals to purchase vegetables is thus\nseveral steps removed from solving the problem. The failure to obtain\nhealth insurance, by contrast, is the immediate cause of the cost-shifting\nCongress sought to address through the ACA. See supra, at 5\u20137.\nRequiring individuals to obtain insurance attacks the source of the\nproblem directly, in a single step.\n30        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                  BUSINESS v.

S., at 33; Wickard, 317 U.

Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 197 (1824)). As the controversy\nsurrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act at\u00ad\ntests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political\nresistance. This prospect is borne out by the behavior of\nstate legislators. Despite their possession of unquestioned\nauthority to impose mandates, state governments have\nrarely done so. See Hall, Commerce Clause Challenges to\nHealth Care Reform, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1825, 1838 (2011).\n   When contemplated in its extreme, almost any power\nlooks dangerous. The commerce power, hypothetically,\nwould enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home\nproduction of all meat, fish, and dairy goods, effectively\ncompelling Americans to eat only vegetables. Cf. Raich,\n545 U. S., at 9; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127\u2013129. Yet no one\nwould offer the \u201chypothetical and unreal possibilit[y],\u201d\nPullman Co. v. Knott, 235 U.

I,\n\u00a78, cl. 1; ante, at 43\u201344. I concur in that determination,\nwhich makes THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s Commerce Clause\nessay all the more puzzling. Why should THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE strive so mightily to hem in Congress\u2019 capacity to\nmeet the new problems arising constantly in our ever\u00ad\ndeveloping modern economy? I find no satisfying response\nto that question in his opinion.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n     But even assuming there were \u201cpracticable\u201d alternatives to the\nminimum coverage provision, \u201cwe long ago rejected the view that the\nNecessary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress be\n\u2018absolutely necessary\u2019 to the exercise of an enumerated power.\u201d Jinks\nv.

See supra, at 31\u201333.\n  12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE states that he must evaluate the constitution\u00ad\n\nality of the minimum coverage provision under the Commerce Clause\nbecause the provision \u201creads more naturally as a command to buy\ninsurance than as a tax.\u201d Ante, at 44.

SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\n                              V\n   Through Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an\nopportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid\nof federal financing. To receive federal Medicaid funds,\nStates must provide health benefits to specified categories\nof needy persons, including pregnant women, children,\nparents, and adults with disabilities. Guaranteed eligibil\u00ad\nity varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal\npoverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it\ndepends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state\nor federal assistance programs. The ACA enlarges the\npopulation of needy people States must cover to include\nadults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the fed-\neral poverty level. The spending power conferred by the\nConstitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Con\u00ad\ngress to define the contours of programs financed with\nfederal funds. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hos-\npital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). And to expand\ncoverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legis\u00ad\nlation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as\nembracive of the poor as Congress chose.\n   The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion,\nthen, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger popula\u00ad\ntion, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may\nit achieve the same result by amending existing law? The\nanswer should be that Congress may expand by amend\u00ad\nment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid\nbenefits. A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal\nand reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the\npopulation served by a federally funded program would\nadvance no constitutional principle and would scarcely\nserve the interests of federalism. To the contrary, such a\nrequirement would rigidify Congress\u2019 efforts to empower\nStates by partnering with them in the implementation of\nfederal programs.\n   Medicaid is a prototypical example of federal-state coop\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Rather\nthan authorizing a federal agency to administer a uni-\nform national health-care system for the poor, Con-\ngress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid\ngrants to their particular needs, so long as they remain\nwithin bounds set by federal law. In shaping Medicaid,\nCongress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms\nparticipating states must meet; instead, Congress re\u00ad\nserved the \u201cright to alter, amend, or repeal\u201d any provision\nof the Medicaid Act. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304. States, for their\npart, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent\nwith changes from time to time made in the federal law.\nSee 42 CFR \u00a7430.12(c)(i) (2011). And from 1965 to the\npresent, States have regularly conformed to Congress\u2019\nalterations of the Medicaid Act.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges that Congress may\n\u201ccondition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States\u2019\ncomplying with restrictions on the use of those funds,\u201d\nante, at 50, but nevertheless concludes that the 2010\nexpansion is unduly coercive. His conclusion rests on\nthree premises, each of them essential to his theory. First,\nthe Medicaid expansion is, in THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s view, a\nnew grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid pro\u00ad\ngram existing before the ACA\u2019s enactment. Congress, THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE maintains, has threatened States with the\nloss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them\nto adopt a new one. Second, the expansion was unforesee\u00ad\nable by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.\nThird, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the\nStates have no real choice but to participate in the Medi\u00ad\ncaid expansion. THE CHIEF JUSTICE therefore\u2014for the\nfirst time ever\u2014finds an exercise of Congress\u2019 spending\npower unconstitutionally coercive.\n   Medicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two\nspending programs; it is a single program with a constant\naim\u2014to enable poor persons to receive basic health care\n40       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nwhen they need it. Given past expansions, plus express\nstatutory warning that Congress may change the re\u00ad\nquirements participating States must meet, there can be\nno tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.\nMoreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medi\u00ad\ncaid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds\non Congress\u2019 terms. Future Congresses are not bound\nby their predecessors\u2019 dispositions; they have authority to\nspend federal revenue as they see fit. The Federal Gov\u00ad\nernment, therefore, is not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE charges,\nthreatening States with the loss of \u201cexisting\u201d funds from\none spending program in order to induce them to opt into\nanother program. Congress is simply requiring States to\ndo what States have long been required to do to receive\nMedicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress\nprescribes for participation.\n   A majority of the Court, however, buys the argument\nthat prospective withholding of funds formerly available\nexceeds Congress\u2019 spending power. Given that holding, I\nentirely agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE as to the appropri\u00ad\nate remedy. It is to bar the withholding found impermis\u00ad\nsible\u2014not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap\nthe expansion altogether, see post, at 46\u201348. The dissent\u00ad\ners\u2019 view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical\ndeparture from the Court\u2019s normal course. When a consti\u00ad\ntutional infirmity mars a statute, the Court ordinarily\nremoves the infirmity. It undertakes a salvage operation;\nit does not demolish the legislation. See, e.g., Brockett v.\nSpokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985) (Court\u2019s\nnormal course is to declare a statute invalid \u201cto the extent\nthat it reaches too far, but otherwise [to leave the statute]\nintact\u201d). That course is plainly in order where, as in this\ncase, Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave\nuntouched every provision not found invalid. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71303.

Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as\npassed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs\njointly administered with the States.13 States were not\nrequired to participate in Medicaid. But if they did, the\nFederal Government paid at least half the costs. To qual-\nify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of\nhealth coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded,\nstate-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with\nDependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind;\nand Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. See\nSocial Security Amendments of 1965, \u00a7121(a), 79 Stat.\n343; Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U.

States have leveraged\nthis policy discretion to generate a myriad of dramatically\ndifferent Medicaid programs over the past several dec\u00ad\nades.\u201d Ruger, Of Icebergs and Glaciers, 75 Law & Con\u00ad\ntemp. Probs. 215, 233 (2012) (footnote omitted). The ACA\ndoes not jettison this approach. States, as first-line ad\u00ad\nministrators, will continue to guide the distribution of\nsubstantial resources among their needy populations.\n   The alternative to conditional federal spending, it bears\nemphasis, is not state autonomy but state marginaliza\u00ad\ntion.16 In 1965, Congress elected to nationalize health\ncoverage for seniors through Medicare. It could similarly\nhave established Medicaid as an exclusively federal pro\u00ad\ngram. Instead, Congress gave the States the opportunity\nto partner in the program\u2019s administration and develop\u00ad\nment. Absent from the nationalized model, of course, is\nthe state-level policy discretion and experimentation that\nis Medicaid\u2019s hallmark; undoubtedly the interests of fed\u00ad\neralism are better served when States retain a meaning-\nful role in the implementation of a program of such\nimportance. See Caminker, State Sovereignty and Sub\u00ad\nordinacy, 95 Colum. L.

In the leading\ndecision in this area, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203\n(1987), the Court identified four criteria. The conditions\nplaced on federal grants to States must (a) promote the\n\u201cgeneral welfare,\u201d (b) \u201cunambiguously\u201d inform States what\nis demanded of them, (c) be germane \u201cto the federal inter\u00ad\nest in particular national projects or programs,\u201d and (d)\nnot \u201cinduce the States to engage in activities that would\nthemselves be unconstitutional.\u201d Id., at 207\u2013208, 210\n(internal quotation marks omitted).18\n   The Court in Dole mentioned, but did not adopt, a fur\u00ad\nther limitation, one hypothetically raised a half-century\nearlier: In \u201csome circumstances,\u201d Congress might be pro\u00ad\nhibited from offering a \u201cfinancial inducement . . . so coer\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 Although the plaintiffs, in the proceedings below, did not contest\nthe ACA\u2019s satisfaction of these criteria, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1263 (CA11\n2011), THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to rely heavily on the second crite-\nrion.

S. 548, 590 (1937)). Prior to today\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion, however, the Court has never ruled that the terms of\nany grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation\nand coercion.\n   Dole involved the National Minimum Drinking Age Act,\n23 U. S. C. \u00a7158, enacted in 1984. That Act directed the\nSecretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal\nhighway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State\npermitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons\nless than 21 years old. Drinking age was not within the\nauthority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued,\nbecause the Twenty-First Amendment gave the States\nexclusive power to control the manufacture, transporta\u00ad\ntion, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The small\npercentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota\nstood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to\npurchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as\ncoercion, the Court concluded.\n   This case does not present the concerns that led the\nCourt in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion. In\nDole, the condition\u2014set 21 as the minimum drinking age\u2014\ndid not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro-\nvided for highway construction. Further, in view of the\nTwenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether\nCongress could directly impose a national minimum\ndrinking age.\n   The ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally\nfunded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply,\nCongress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked\nfor any other program. Nor does the ACA use Medicaid\nfunding to induce States to take action Congress itself\ncould not undertake. The Federal Government undoubt\u00ad\nedly could operate its own health-care program for poor\npersons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors\u2019 health\n48       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

Congress, aiming to assist\nthe needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize\nstate health-insurance programs that meet federal stand\u00ad\nards. The principal standard the ACA sets is that the\nstate program cover adults earning no more than 133% of\nthe federal poverty line. Enforcing that prescription en\u00ad\nsures that federal funds will be spent on health care for\nthe poor in furtherance of Congress\u2019 present perception of\nthe general welfare.\n                               C\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the Medicaid expan\u00ad\nsion creates a \u201cnew health care program.\u201d Ante, at 54.\nMoreover, States could \u201chardly anticipate\u201d that Congress\nwould \u201ctransform [the program] so dramatically.\u201d Ante,\nat 55. Therefore, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, Congress\u2019\nthreat to withhold \u201cold\u201d Medicaid funds based on a State\u2019s\nrefusal to participate in the \u201cnew\u201d program is a \u201cthrea[t] to\nterminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].\u201d Ante, at 50,\n52\u201353. And because the threat to withhold a large amount\nof funds from one program \u201cleaves the States with no real\noption but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],\u201d THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE concludes, the Medicaid expansion is un\u00ad\nconstitutionally coercive. Ante, at 52.\n                            1\n  The starting premise on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s\ncoercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really\n\u201cextend\u201d Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely\nnew program to co-exist with the old. THE CHIEF JUSTICE\ncalls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of\nAmerica\u2019s poor than Congress originally covered.\n  Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medi\u00ad\ncal assistance to \u201cneedy persons.\u201d See S. Rep. No. 404,\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          49\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\n89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 9 (1965). See also \u00a7121(a),\n79 Stat. 343 (The purpose of Medicaid is to enable States\n\u201cto furnish . . . medical assistance on behalf of [certain\npersons] whose income and resources are insufficient to\nmeet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d). By bring\u00ad\ning health care within the reach of a larger population of\nAmericans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is\nan extension of that basic aim.\n   The Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions gov\u00ad\nerning operation of the program, setting conditions rang\u00ad\ning from \u201cLimitation on payments to States for expend-\nitures attributable to taxes,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(t) (2006\ned.), to \u201cMedical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted\nfor permanent residence,\u201d \u00a71396b(v) (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIV). The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast\nmajority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the\nexisting program and specifies the rate at which States\nwill be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene-\nficiaries. See ACA \u00a7\u00a72001(a)(1), (3), 124 Stat. 271\u2013272.\nThe ACA does not describe operational aspects of the\nprogram for these newly eligible persons; for that infor\u00ad\nmation, one must read the existing Medicaid Act. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71396\u20131396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\n   Congress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expan\u00ad\nsion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a \u201cnew\u201d\nhealth-care program. To the four categories of beneficiar\u00ad\nies for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965, and the\nthree mandatory classes added in the late 1980\u2019s, see\nsupra, at 41\u201342, the ACA adds an eighth: individuals\nunder 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal\npoverty level. The expansion is effectuated by \u00a72001 of the\nACA, aptly titled: \u201cMedicaid Coverage for the Lowest\nIncome Populations.\u201d 124 Stat. 271. That section amends\nTitle 42, Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX: Grants to States for\nMedical Assistance Programs.

S., at 594.\nEven if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress\u2019\nconception of the character of its legislation, how would\nreviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, pur\u00ad\nporting to amend a law, is in reality not an amendment,\nbut a new creation? At what point does an extension\nbecome so large that it \u201ctransforms\u201d the basic law?\n   Endeavoring to show that Congress created a new pro\u00ad\ngram, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites three aspects of the ex\u00ad\npansion. First, he asserts that, in covering those earning\nno more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medi\u00ad\ncaid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not \u201ccare\nfor the neediest among us.\u201d Ante, at 53.

That less comprehensive\nbenefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced\nby the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for\nmany of their Medicaid beneficiaries.20 The level of bene\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 Compare Subchapter XIX, 42 U.

Under pre-ACA Medi\u00ad\ncaid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs\nof coverage for current enrollees, \u00a71396d(b) (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV); under the ACA, the federal contribution starts\nat 100% and will eventually settle at 90%, \u00a71396d(y).\nEven if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percent\u00ad\nage points carries constitutional significance, is it not\npassing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on\nstate sovereignty might have been averted, or at least\nmitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry\nout the same obligations?\n   Consider also that Congress could have repealed Medi\u00ad\ncaid. See supra, at 38\u201339 (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304); Brief\nfor Petitioners in No. 11\u2013400, p. 41. Thereafter, Congress\ncould have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin\u00ad\ning the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage\nrequired by the ACA. By what right does a court stop\nCongress from building up without first tearing down?\n                             2\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the Medicaid expansion vul\u00ad\nnerable because it took participating States by surprise.\nAnte, at 54. \u201cA State could hardly anticipate that Con\u00ad\ngres[s]\u201d would endeavor to \u201ctransform [the Medicaid pro\u00ad\ngram] so dramatically,\u201d he states.

SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nJUSTICE cites only one case: Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1.\n   In Pennhurst, residents of a state-run, federally funded\ninstitution for the mentally disabled complained of abu\u00ad\nsive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged viola\u00ad\ntion of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill\nof Rights Act. 451 U. S., at 5\u20136. We held that the State\nwas not answerable in damages for violating conditions\nit did not \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly accep[t].\u201d Id., at 17,\n27. Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his\u00ad\ntory, we found that the Act did not \u201cunambiguously\u201d im\u00ad\npose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied: that\nthey receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive\nenvironment. Id., at 17\u201318. Satisfied that Congress had\nnot clearly conditioned the States\u2019 receipt of federal funds\non the States\u2019 provision of such treatment, we declined to\nread such a requirement into the Act. Congress\u2019 spending\npower, we concluded, \u201cdoes not include surprising partici\u00ad\npating States with postacceptance or \u2018retroactive\u2019 condi\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Id., at 24\u201325.\n   Pennhurst thus instructs that \u201cif Congress intends to\nimpose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must\ndo so unambiguously.\u201d Ante, at 53 (quoting Pennhurst,\n451 U. S., at 17). That requirement is met in this case.\nSection 2001 does not take effect until 2014. The ACA\nmakes perfectly clear what will be required of States that\naccept Medicaid funding after that date: They must extend\neligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133% of\nthe federal poverty line. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)\n(i)(VIII) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to find in Pennhurst a\nrequirement that, when spending legislation is first\npassed, or when States first enlist in the federal program,\nCongress must provide clear notice of conditions it might\nlater impose. If I understand his point correctly, it was\nincumbent on Congress, in 1965, to warn the States clearly\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  53\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nof the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might\ntake. And absent such notice, sizable changes could not be\nmade mandatory. Our decisions do not support such a\nrequirement.21\n   In Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632 (1985), the\nSecretary of Education sought to recoup Title I funds22\nbased on the State\u2019s noncompliance, from 1970 to 1972,\nwith a 1978 amendment to Title I. Relying on Pennhurst,\nwe rejected the Secretary\u2019s attempt to recover funds based\non the States\u2019 alleged violation of a rule that did not exist\nwhen the State accepted and spent the funds. See 470\nU. S., at 640 (\u201cNew Jersey[,] when it applied for and re\u00ad\nceived Title I funds for the years 1970\u20131972[,] had no\nbasis to believe that the propriety of the expenditures\nwould be judged by any standards other than the ones in\neffect at the time.\u201d (citing Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17, 24\u2013\n25; emphasis added)).\n   When amendment of an existing grant program has no\nsuch retroactive effect, however, we have upheld Congress\u2019\ninstruction. In Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S.\n656 (1985), the Secretary sued to recapture Title I funds\nbased on the Commonwealth\u2019s 1974 violation of a spend\u00ad\ning condition Congress added to Title I in 1970. Rejecting\nKentucky\u2019s argument pinned to Pennhurst, we held that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes that \u201cSpending Clause legislation\n\n[i]s much in the nature of a contract.\u201d Ante, at 46 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). See also post, at 33 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY,\nTHOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (same). But the Court previously has rec-\nognized that \u201c[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant\nprograms originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions\nexpressing the judgment of Congress concerning desirable public\npolicy.\u201d Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 669 (1985).\n   22 Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965\n\nprovided federal grants to finance supplemental educational programs\nin school districts with high concentrations of children from low-income\nfamilies. See Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632, 634\u2013635 (1985)\n(citing Pub. L. No. 89\u201310, 79 Stat. 27).\n54       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nthe Commonwealth suffered no surprise after accepting\nthe federal funds. Kentucky was therefore obliged to re-\nturn the money. 470 U. S., at 665\u2013666, 673\u2013674. The\nconditions imposed were to be assessed as of 1974, in light\nof \u201cthe legal requirements in place when the grants were\nmade,\u201d id., at 670, not as of 1965, when Title I was origi\u00ad\nnally enacted.\n    As these decisions show, Pennhurst\u2019s rule demands that\nconditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the\ntime a State receives and uses the money\u2014not at the time,\nperhaps years earlier, when Congress passed the law\nestablishing the program. See also Dole, 483 U. S., at 208\n(finding Pennhurst satisfied based on the clarity of the\nFederal Aid Highway Act as amended in 1984, without\nlooking back to 1956, the year of the Act\u2019s adoption).\n    In any event, from the start, the Medicaid Act put\nStates on notice that the program could be changed: \u201cThe\nright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of [Medi\u00ad\ncaid],\u201d the statute has read since 1965, \u201cis hereby reserved\nto the Congress.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304. The \u201ceffect of these\nfew simple words\u201d has long been settled. See National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R.\nCo., 470 U. S. 451, 467\u2013468, n. 22 (1985) (citing Sinking\nFund Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 720 (1879)). By reserving the\nright to \u201calter, amend, [or] repeal\u201d a spending program,\nCongress \u201chas given special notice of its intention to retain\n. . . full and complete power to make such alterations and\namendments . . . as come within the just scope of legisla\u00ad\ntive power.\u201d Id., at 720.\n    Our decision in Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to\nSocial Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41, 51\u201352 (1986), is\nguiding here. As enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act\ndid not cover state employees. Id., at 44. In response to\npressure from States that wanted coverage for their em\u00ad\nployees, Congress, in 1950, amended the Act to allow\nStates to opt into the program. Id., at 45. The statutory\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           55\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nprovision giving States this option expressly permitted\nthem to withdraw from the program. Ibid.\n   Beginning in the late 1970\u2019s, States increasingly exer\u00ad\ncised the option to withdraw. Id., at 46. Concerned that\nwithdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social\nSecurity, Congress repealed the termination provision.\nCongress thereby changed Social Security from a program\nvoluntary for the States to one from which they could not\nescape. Id., at 48. California objected, arguing that the\nchange impermissibly deprived it of a right to withdraw\nfrom Social Security. Id., at 49\u201350. We unanimously\nrejected California\u2019s argument. Id., at 51\u201353. By includ\u00ad\ning in the Act \u201ca clause expressly reserving to it \u2018[t]he\nright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u2019 of the Act,\u201d\nwe held, Congress put States on notice that the Act\n\u201ccreated no contractual rights.\u201d Id., at 51\u201352. The States\ntherefore had no law-based ground on which to complain\nabout the amendment, despite the significant character of\nthe change.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE nevertheless would rewrite \u00a71304\nto countenance only the \u201cright to alter somewhat,\u201d or\n\u201camend, but not too much.\u201d Congress, however, did not so\nqualify \u00a71304. Indeed, Congress retained discretion to\n\u201crepeal\u201d Medicaid, wiping it out entirely. Cf. Delta Air\nLines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 368 (1981) (Rehnquist,\nJ., dissenting) (invoking \u201cthe common-sense maxim that\nthe greater includes the lesser\u201d). As Bowen indicates, no\nState could reasonably have read \u00a71304 as reserving to\nCongress authority to make adjustments only if modestly\nsized.\n   In fact, no State proceeded on that understanding. In com\u00ad\npliance with Medicaid regulations, each State expressly\nundertook to abide by future Medicaid changes. See 42\nCFR \u00a7430.12(c)(1) (2011) (\u201cThe [state Medicaid] plan must\nprovide that it will be amended whenever necessary to\nreflect . . . [c]hanges in Federal law, regulations, policy\n56         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

Whenever a State\nnotifies the Federal Government of a change in its own\nMedicaid program, the State certifies both that it knows\nthe federally set terms of participation may change, and\nthat it will abide by those changes as a condition of con\u00ad\ntinued participation. See, e.g., Florida Agency for Health\nCare Admin., State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act Medical Assistance Program \u00a77.1, p. 86 (Oct.\n6, 1992).\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists that the most recent expan\u00ad\nsion, in contrast to its predecessors, \u201caccomplishes a shift\nin kind, not merely degree.\u201d Ante, at 53. But why was\nMedicaid altered only in degree, not in kind, when Con\u00ad\ngress required States to cover millions of children and\npregnant women? See supra, at 41\u201342. Congress did not\n\u201cmerely alte[r] and expan[d] the boundaries of \u201d the Aid to\nFamilies with Dependent Children program. But see ante,\nat 53\u201355. Rather, Congress required participating States\nto provide coverage tied to the federal poverty level (as it\nlater did in the ACA), rather than to the AFDC program.\nSee Brief for National Health Law Program et al. as Amici\nCuriae 16\u201318. In short, given \u00a71304, this Court\u2019s con\u00ad\nstruction of \u00a71304\u2019s language in Bowen, and the enlarge\u00ad\nment of Medicaid in the years since 1965,23 a State would\nbe hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when,\nin 2010, Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger\nportion of the Nation\u2019s poor.\n                             3\n     THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately asks whether \u201cthe finan\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 Note, in this regard, the extension of Social Security, which began\n\nin 1935 as an old-age pension program, then expanded to include sur-\nvivor benefits in 1939 and disability benefits in 1956.

S., at 591, \u201cwhere persua\u00ad\nsion gives way to coercion,\u201d ante, at 55. Neither do the\njoint dissenters.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nrecognizes Congress\u2019 authority to construct a single federal program\nand \u201ccondition the receipt of funds on the States\u2019 complying with\nrestrictions on the use of those funds.\u201d Ante, at 50. For the joint\ndissenters, however, all that matters, it appears, is whether States can\nresist the temptation of a given federal grant. Post, at 35. On this\nlogic, any federal spending program, sufficiently large and well-funded,\nwould be unconstitutional. The joint dissenters point to smaller pro\u00ad\ngrams States might have the will to refuse. See post, at 40\u201341 (elemen\u00ad\ntary and secondary education). But how is a court to judge whether\n\u201conly 6.6% of all state expenditures,\u201d post, at 41, is an amount States\ncould or would do without?\n   Speculations of this genre are characteristic of the joint dissent. See,\ne.g., post, at 35 (\u201cit may be state officials who will bear the brunt of\npublic disapproval\u201d for joint federal-state endeavors); ibid., (\u201cfederal\nofficials . . . may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of\ntheir decision\u201d); post, at 37 (\u201ca heavy federal tax . . . levied to support a\nfederal program that offers large grants to the States . . . may, as a\npractical matter, [leave States] unable to refuse to participate\u201d); ibid.\n(withdrawal from a federal program \u201cwould likely force the State to\nimpose a huge tax increase\u201d); post, at 46 (state share of ACA expansion\ncosts \u201cmay increase in the future\u201d) (all emphasis added; some internal\nquotation marks omitted).

Ante, at 48. Are courts to\nmeasure the number of dollars the Federal Government\nmight withhold for noncompliance? The portion of the\nState\u2019s budget at stake? And which State\u2019s\u2014or States\u2019\u2014\nbudget is determinative: the lead plaintiff, all challenging\nStates (26 in this case, many with quite different fiscal\nsituations), or some national median? Does it matter that\nFlorida, unlike most States, imposes no state income tax,\nand therefore might be able to replace foregone federal\nfunds with new state revenue?26 Or that the coercion state\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npossibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\u201d). We should not lightly\nascribe to Congress an intent to violate the Constitution (at least as my\ncolleagues read it). This is particularly true when the ACA could just\nas well be comprehended as demonstrating Congress\u2019 mere expectation,\nin light of the uniformity of past participation and the generosity of the\nfederal contribution, that States would not withdraw. Cf. South Dakota\nv. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211 (1987) (\u201cWe cannot conclude . . . that a con\u00ad\nditional grant of federal money . . . is unconstitutional simply by\nreason of its success in achieving the congressional objective.\u201d).\n   26 Federal taxation of a State\u2019s citizens, according to the joint dissent\u00ad\n\ners, may diminish a State\u2019s ability to raise new revenue. This, in turn,\ncould limit a State\u2019s capacity to replace a federal program with an\n\u201cequivalent\u201d state-funded analog. Post, at 40. But it cannot be true\nthat \u201cthe amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a\nState to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining\nwhether there is impermissible coercion.\u201d Post, at 37.

See Baker\nv. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 217 (1962). Even commentators\nsympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole\u2019s limitations,\nsee supra, at 46, have concluded that conceptions of\n\u201cimpermissible coercion\u201d premised on States\u2019 perceived\ninability to decline federal funds \u201care just too amorphous\nto be judicially administrable.\u201d Baker & Berman, Getting\noff the Dole, 78 Ind.

Rev. 1175 (1989)).\n   At bottom, my colleagues\u2019 position is that the States\u2019\nreliance on federal funds limits Congress\u2019 authority to\nalter its spending programs. This gets things backwards:\nCongress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal\nmoney in service of the general welfare. And each succes\u00ad\nsive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees\nfit. When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about\nMedicaid funds that differed from its predecessors\u2019 view,\nit abridged no State\u2019s right to \u201cexisting,\u201d or \u201cpre-existing,\u201d\nfunds.

C. \u00a71396c.27 THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE, however, holds that the Constitution precludes\nthe Secretary from withholding \u201cexisting\u201d Medicaid funds\nbased on States\u2019 refusal to comply with the expanded Medi\u00ad\ncaid program. Ante, at 55. For the foregoing reasons, I\ndisagree that any such withholding would violate the\nSpending Clause. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision\nof the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this\nregard.\n  But in view of THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s disposition, I agree\nwith him that the Medicaid Act\u2019s severability clause de\u00ad\ntermines the appropriate remedy. That clause provides\nthat \u201c[i]f any provision of [the Medicaid Act], or the appli\u00ad\ncation thereof to any person or circumstance, is held in-\nvalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of\nsuch provision to other persons or circumstances shall not\nbe affected thereby.\u201d 42 U. S.

See ante, at 51. But total\nwithdrawal is what the Secretary may, not must, do. She has discre\u00ad\ntion to withhold only a portion of the Medicaid funds otherwise due a\nnoncompliant State. See \u00a71396c; cf. 45 CFR \u00a780.10(f) (2011) (Secretary\nmay enforce Title VI\u2019s nondiscrimination requirement through \u201crefusal\nto grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part.\u201d\n(emphasis added)). The Secretary, it is worth noting, may herself\nexperience political pressures, which would make her all the more\nreluctant to cut off funds Congress has appropriated for a State\u2019s needy\ncitizens.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          61\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nACA. It prohibits only the \u201capplication\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s\nauthority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that\ndecline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA\u2019s\nrequirements. Thus the ACA\u2019s authorization of funds to\nfinance the expansion remains intact, and the Secretary\u2019s\nauthority to withhold funds for reasons other than non\u00ad\ncompliance with the expansion remains unaffected.\n   Even absent \u00a71303\u2019s command, we would have no war\u00ad\nrant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion, contra post, at\n46\u201348 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and\nALITO, JJ.), not to mention the entire ACA, post, at 49\u201364\n(same). For when a court confronts an unconstitutional\nstatute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy,\nthe legislature\u2019s dominant objective. See, e.g., Ayotte v.\nPlanned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320,\n328\u2013330 (2006). In this case, that objective was to in\u00ad\ncrease access to health care for the poor by increasing the\nStates\u2019 access to federal funds. THE CHIEF JUSTICE is\nundoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer\nStates funds \u201cto expand the availability of health care, and\nrequir[e] that States accepting such funds comply with the\nconditions on their use.\u201d Ante, at 55. I therefore concur\nin the judgment with respect to Part IV\u2013B of THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE\u2019s opinion.\n                        *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nthat, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi\u00ad\nsion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision en-\ncounters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would\nuphold the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision that the Medicaid\nexpansion is within Congress\u2019 spending power.\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

It can assuredly do that, by exercis-\ning the powers accorded to it under the Constitution. The\nquestion in this case, however, is whether the complex\nstructures and provisions of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go be-\nyond those powers. We conclude that they do.\n  This case is in one respect difficult: it presents two\n2       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nquestions of first impression. The first of those is whether\nfailure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of\nhealth insurance) is subject to regulation under the Com-\nmerce Clause. Failure to act does result in an effect\non commerce, and hence might be said to come under\nthis Court\u2019s \u201caffecting commerce\u201d criterion of Commerce\nClause jurisprudence. But in none of its decisions has this\nCourt extended the Clause that far. The second question\nis whether the congressional power to tax and spend,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1, permits the conditioning of\na State\u2019s continued receipt of all funds under a massive\nstate-administered federal welfare program upon its ac-\nceptance of an expansion to that program. Several of our\nopinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend\ncannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal\nprogram, but we have never found a law enacted under\nthe spending power to be coercive. Those questions are\ndifficult.\n  The case is easy and straightforward, however, in an-\nother respect. What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the\ntext of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment\nratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the\n220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon\nfederal power\u2014upon what it can prescribe with respect to\nprivate conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the\nsovereign States. Whatever may be the conceptual limits\nupon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax\nand spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal\nGovernment to regulate all private conduct and to com-\npel the States to function as administrators of federal\nprograms.\n  That clear principle carries the day here. The striking\ncase of Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), which\nheld that the economic activity of growing wheat, even\nfor one\u2019s own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently\nthat it could be regulated, always has been regarded as\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nthe ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurispru-\ndence. To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow\nwheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity\nat all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be\nfederally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out\nthe basis for federal prescription and to extend federal\npower to virtually all human activity.\n  As for the constitutional power to tax and spend for\nthe general welfare: The Court has long since expanded\nthat beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and\nspending for those aspects of the general welfare that were\nwithin the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers,\nsee United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 65\u201366 (1936).\nThus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted\nto subjects not mentioned among Congress\u2019 enumerated\npowers, and only marginally related to commerce: the De-\npartment of Education, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services, the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment. The principal practical obstacle that pre-\nvents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to\nassume all the general-welfare responsibilities tradition-\nally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of\nmanaging a Federal Government large enough to adminis-\nter such a system. That obstacle can be overcome by\ngranting funds to the States, allowing them to administer\nthe program. That is fair and constitutional enough when\nthe States freely agree to have their powers employed and\ntheir employees enlisted in the federal scheme. But it is a\nblatant violation of the constitutional structure when the\nStates have no choice.\n  The Act before us here exceeds federal power both in\nmandating the purchase of health insurance and in deny-\ning nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding. These\nparts of the Act are central to its design and operation,\nand all the Act\u2019s other provisions would not have been\nenacted without them. In our view it must follow that the\n4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nentire statute is inoperative.\n                               I\n                 The Individual Mandate\n   Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution gives Congress the\npower to \u201cregulate Commerce . . . among the several\nStates.\u201d The Individual Mandate in the Act commands\nthat every \u201capplicable individual shall for each month\nbeginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any\ndependent of the individual who is an applicable individ-\nual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.\u201d 26\nU. S. C. \u00a75000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). If this provision\n\u201cregulates\u201d anything, it is the failure to maintain mini-\nmum essential coverage. One might argue that it regu-\nlates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by\npayment of a penalty. But that failure\u2014that abstention\nfrom commerce\u2014is not \u201cCommerce.\u201d To be sure, purchas-\ning insurance is \u201dCommerce\u201d; but one does not regulate\ncommerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.\n   In Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196 (1824), Chief\nJustice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate com-\nmerce is the power \u201cto prescribe the rule by which\ncommerce is to be governed.\u201d That understanding is con-\nsistent with the original meaning of \u201cregulate\u201d at the time\nof the Constitution\u2019s ratification, when \u201cto regulate\u201d meant\n\u201c[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,\u201d 2 N.\nWebster, An American Dictionary of the English Lan-\nguage (1828); \u201c[t]o adjust by rule or method,\u201d 2 S.

There is no instance in which this Court or Con-\ngress (or anyone else, to our knowledge) has used \u201cregulate\u201d\nin that peculiar fashion. If the word bore that meaning,\nCongress\u2019 authority \u201c[t]o make Rules for the Govern-\nment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,\u201d U. S.\nConst., Art.

But when Congress provides that\n(nearly) all citizens must buy an insurance contract, it\ngoes beyond \u201cadjust[ing] by rule or method,\u201d Johnson,\nsupra, or \u201cdirect[ing] according to rule,\u201d Ash, supra; it\ndirects the creation of commerce.\n   In response, the Government offers two theories as to\nwhy the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitu-\ntional. Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity.\n                              A\n  First, the Government submits that \u00a75000A is \u201cintegral\nto the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance reforms\u201d and \u201cnec-\nessary to make effective the Act\u2019s core reforms.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners in No. 11\u2013398 (Minimum Coverage Provi-\nsion) 24 (hereinafter Petitioners\u2019 Minimum Coverage Brief).\nCongress included a \u201cfinding\u201d to similar effect in the Act\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The most authoritative legal dictionaries of the founding era lack\n\nany definition for \u201cregulate\u201d or \u201cregulation,\u201d suggesting that the term\nbears its ordinary meaning (rather than some specialized legal mean-\ning) in the constitutional text. See R. Burn, A New Law Dictionary 281\n(1792); G. Jacob, A New Law Dictionary (10th ed. 1782); 2 T.

SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nitself. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(H).\n   As discussed in more detail in Part V, infra, the Act\ncontains numerous health insurance reforms, but most\nnotable for present purposes are the \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d\nand \u201ccommunity rating\u201d provisions, \u00a7\u00a7300gg to 300gg\u20134.\nThe former provides that, with a few exceptions, \u201ceach\nhealth insurance issuer that offers health insurance cov-\nerage in the individual or group market in a State must\naccept every employer and individual in the State that\napplies for such coverage.\u201d \u00a7300gg\u20131(a). That is, an in-\nsurer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other\nthings, any pre-existing medical condition that the appli-\ncant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover\nthat condition. See \u00a7300gg\u20133.\n   Under ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would\nrespond by charging high premiums to individuals with\npre-existing conditions. The Act seeks to prevent this\nthrough the community-rating provision. Simply put, the\ncommunity-rating provision requires insurers to calculate\nan individual\u2019s insurance premium based on only four\nfactors: (i) whether the individual\u2019s plan covers just\nthe individual or his family also, (ii) the \u201crating area\u201d in\nwhich the individual lives, (iii) the individual\u2019s age, and\n(iv) whether the individual uses tobacco. \u00a7300gg(a)(1)(A).\nAside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and\npossibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to\nfactor the individual\u2019s health characteristics into the price\nof his insurance premium. This creates a new incentive\nfor young and healthy individuals without pre-existing\nconditions. The insurance premiums for those in this\ngroup will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will\nsubsidize insurance for others in the pool. Many of them\nmay decide that purchasing health insurance is not an eco-\nnomically sound decision\u2014especially since the guaranteed-\nissue provision will enable them to purchase it at the\nsame cost in later years and even if they have developed a\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\npre-existing condition. But without the contribution of\nabove-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the\ncommunity-rating provision will not enable insurers to\ntake on high-risk individuals without a massive increase\nin premiums.\n    The Government presents the Individual Mandate as a\nunique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme govern-\ning many parties with countervailing incentives that must\nbe carefully balanced. Congress has imposed an extensive\nset of regulations on the health insurance industry, and\ncompliance with those regulations will likely cost the in-\ndustry a great deal. If the industry does not respond by\nincreasing premiums, it is not likely to survive. And if\nthe industry does increase premiums, then there is a seri-\nous risk that its products\u2014insurance plans\u2014will become\neconomically undesirable for many and prohibitively ex-\npensive for the rest.\n    This is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health-\ninsurance industry.       Government regulation typically\nimposes costs on the regulated industry\u2014especially regu-\nlation that prohibits economic behavior in which most\nmarket participants are already engaging, such as \u201cpiec-\ning out\u201d the market by selling the product to different\nclasses of people at different prices (in the present context,\nproviding much lower insurance rates to young and\nhealthy buyers). And many industries so regulated face\nthe reality that, without an artificial increase in demand,\nthey cannot continue on. When Congress is regulating\nthese industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to\nenact \u201c \u2018all appropriate legislation\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018protec[t]\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201c \u2018advanc[e]\u2019 \u201d commerce, NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel\nCorp., 301 U. S. 1, 36\u201337 (1937) (quoting The Daniel Ball,\n10 Wall. 557, 564 (1871)). Thus, Congress might protect\nthe imperiled industry by prohibiting low-cost competition,\nor by according it preferential tax treatment, or even by\ngranting it a direct subsidy.\n8        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\n  Here, however, Congress has impressed into service\nthird parties, healthy individuals who could be but are not\ncustomers of the relevant industry, to offset the undesir-\nable consequences of the regulation. Congress\u2019 desire to\nforce these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated\nby the fact that they are further removed from the market\nthan unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions,\nbecause they are less likely to need extensive care in\nthe near future. If Congress can reach out and command\neven those furthest removed from an interstate market to\nparticipate in the market, then the Commerce Clause\nbecomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton\u2019s words,\n\u201cthe hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare\nneither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor pro-\nfane.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, p. 202 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\n  At the outer edge of the commerce power, this Court has\ninsisted on careful scrutiny of regulations that do not\nact directly on an interstate market or its participants. In\nNew York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), we held\nthat Congress could not, in an effort to regulate the dis-\nposal of radioactive waste produced in several different\nindustries, order the States to take title to that waste.\nId., at 174\u2013177. In Printz v. United States, 521 U.

Id., at 933\u2013935. In United States v.\nLopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), we held that Congress could\nnot, as a means of fostering an educated interstate labor\nmarket through the protection of schools, ban the posses-\nsion of a firearm within a school zone. Id., at 559\u2013563.\nAnd in United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000), we\nheld that Congress could not, in an effort to ensure the full\nparticipation of women in the interstate economy, subject\nprivate individuals and companies to suit for gender-\nmotivated violent torts.

And\nthe last two of these cases show that the scope of the\nNecessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when\nthe congressional action directly violates the sovereignty\nof the States but also when it violates the background\nprinciple of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.\n   The case upon which the Government principally relies\nto sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary\nand Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005).\nThat case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain\nthe interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultiva-\ntion and possession of that drug. Id., at 15\u201322. Raich\nis no precedent for what Congress has done here. That\ncase\u2019s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, 317 U. S. 111),\nand of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not\nrepresent the expansion of the federal power to direct into\na broad new field. The mandating of economic activity\ndoes, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the\nCommerce Clause into a general authority to direct the\neconomy, that mandating is not \u201cconsist[ent] with the\nletter and spirit of the constitution.\u201d McCulloch v. Mary-\nland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).\n   Moreover, Raich is far different from the Individual\nMandate in another respect. The Court\u2019s opinion in Raich\npointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions\nwere the only practicable way of enabling the prohibition\nof interstate traffic in marijuana to be effectively enforced.\n545 U. S., at 22. See also Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S.\n342 (1914) (Necessary and Proper Clause allows regula-\ntions of intrastate transactions if necessary to the regula-\ntion of an interstate market). Intrastate marijuana could\nno more be distinguished from interstate marijuana than,\nfor example, endangered-species trophies obtained before\n10       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979).\n  With the present statute, by contrast, there are many\nways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate\nby which the regulatory scheme\u2019s goals of reducing insur-\nance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers\ncould be achieved. For instance, those who did not pur-\nchase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when\nthey do enter the health insurance system. Or they could\nbe denied a full income tax credit given to those who do\npurchase the insurance.\n  The Government was invited, at oral argument, to\nsuggest what federal controls over private conduct (other\nthan those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or\nother constitutional controls) could not be justified as\nnecessary and proper for the carrying out of a general\nregulatory scheme. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\u201330, 43\u201345\n(Mar. 27, 2012). It was unable to name any. As we said at\nthe outset, whereas the precise scope of the Commerce\nClause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain,\nthe proposition that the Federal Government cannot do\neverything is a fundamental precept. See Lopez, 514 U. S.,\nat 564 (\u201c[I]f we were to accept the Government\u2019s argu-\nments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an in-\ndividual that Congress is without power to regulate\u201d).\nSection 5000A is defeated by that proposition.\n                              B\n  The Government\u2019s second theory in support of the In-\ndividual Mandate is that \u00a75000A is valid because it is\nactually a \u201cregulat[ion of] activities having a substantial\nrelation to interstate commerce, . . . i.e., . . . activities that\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce.\u201d Id., at 558\u2013559.\nSee also Shreveport Rate Cases, supra.

That is,\nthe provision directs the manner in which individuals\npurchase health care services and related goods (directing\nthat they be purchased through insurance) and is there-\nfore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power.\n  The primary problem with this argument is that \u00a75000A\ndoes not apply only to persons who purchase all, or most,\nor even any, of the health care services or goods that the\nmandated insurance covers. Indeed, the main objection\nmany have to the Mandate is that they have no intention\nof purchasing most or even any of such goods or services\nand thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases.\nThe Government responds that the health-care market\ninvolves \u201cessentially universal participation,\u201d id., at 35.\nThe principal difficulty with this response is that it is, in\nthe only relevant sense, not true. It is true enough that\neveryone consumes \u201chealth care,\u201d if the term is taken to\ninclude the purchase of a bottle of aspirin. But the health\ncare \u201cmarket\u201d that is the object of the Individual Mandate\nnot only includes but principally consists of goods and\nservices that the young people primarily affected by the\nMandate do not purchase. They are quite simply not\nparticipants in that market, and cannot be made so (and\nthereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of\ndefining participants to include all those who will, later in\ntheir lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services\ncovered by the mandated insurance.2 Such a definition of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE GINSBURG is therefore right to note that Congress is \u201cnot\n\nmandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.\u201d Ante, at 22\n(opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dis-\n12        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v.

But as the discussion above makes clear, the\ndecision to forgo participation in an interstate market is\nnot itself commercial activity (or indeed any activity at all)\nwithin Congress\u2019 power to regulate. It is true that, at the\nend of the day, it is inevitable that each American will\naffect commerce and become a part of it, even if not by\nchoice. But if every person comes within the Commerce\nClause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason\nthat he will one day engage in commerce, the idea of a\nlimited Government power is at an end.\n   Wickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most ex-\npansive assertion of the commerce power in our history. A\nclose second is Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971),\nwhich upheld a statute criminalizing the eminently local\nactivity of loan-sharking. Both of those cases, however,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsenting in part). Instead, it is mandating the purchase of an unwanted\nsuite of products\u2014e.g., physician office visits, emergency room visits,\nhospital room and board, physical therapy, durable medical equipment,\nmental health care, and substance abuse detoxification.

To go beyond that, and to\nsay that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make\nloans affects commerce, so that growing and lending can\nbe federally compelled, is to extend federal power to virtu-\nally everything. All of us consume food, and when we do\nso the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality\nmust be and even how much we must pay. But the mere\nfact that we all consume food and are thus, sooner or later,\nparticipants in the \u201cmarket\u201d for food, does not empower\nthe Government to say when and what we will buy. That\nis essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the\npurchase of health care. It exceeds federal power.\n                               C\n    A few respectful responses to JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s dis-\nsent on the issue of the Mandate are in order. That dis-\nsent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that\nour opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the\ntest contains. It is true enough that Congress needs only a\n\u201c \u2018rational basis\u2019 for concluding that the regulated activity\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce,\u201d ante, at 15 (em-\nphasis added). But it must be activity affecting com-\nmerce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to\nengage in commerce. And one is not now purchasing\nthe health care covered by the insurance mandate simply\nbecause one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our\ntest\u2019s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of\nwhole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution\u2019s requirement\nthat it be commerce which is regulated. If all inactivity\naffecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.\nUltimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is\nreally no difference between action and inaction, ante, at\n26, a proposition that has never recommended itself,\nneither to the law nor to common sense. To say, for exam-\nple, that the inaction here consists of activity in \u201cthe self-\ninsurance market,\u201d ibid., seems to us wordplay.

It threatens that order\nbecause it gives such an expansive meaning to the Com-\nmerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to\nact) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroy-\ning the Constitution\u2019s division of governmental powers.\nThus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity\nof the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional\nrelation between the individual and the National Govern-\nment. The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper\nClause has been held to include \u201cthe power to enact crimi-\nnal laws, . . . the power to imprison, . . . and the power to\ncreate a national bank,\u201d ante, at 34\u201335. Is not the power\nto compel purchase of health insurance much lesser? No,\nnot if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests\nupon a theory that everything is within federal control\nsimply because it exists.\n   The dissent\u2019s exposition of the wonderful things the Fed-\neral Government has achieved through exercise of its\nassigned powers, such as \u201cthe provision of old-age and\nsurvivors\u2019 benefits\u201d in the Social Security Act, ante, at 2,\nis quite beside the point. The issue here is whether the\nfederal government can impose the Individual Mandate\nthrough the Commerce Clause. And the relevant history\nis not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful\nresults through the proper exercise of its assigned powers\nin the past, but that it has never before used the Com-\nmerce Clause to compel entry into commerce.3 The dissent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 In   its effort to show the contrary, JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019S dissent comes\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

It enumerates not federally\nsoluble problems, but federally available powers. The\nFederal Government can address whatever problems it\nwants but can bring to their solution only those powers\nthat the Constitution confers, among which is the power to\nregulate commerce. None of our cases say anything else.\nArticle I contains no whatever-it-takes-to-solve-a-national-\nproblem power.\n  The dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to\ncompel entry into the health-insurance market would\ninclude the power to compel entry into the new-car or\nbroccoli markets. The latter purchasers, it says, \u201cwill be\nobliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nup with nothing more than two condemnation cases, which it says\ndemonstrate \u201cCongress\u2019 authority under the commerce power to compel\nan \u2018inactive\u2019 landholder to submit to an unwanted sale.\u201d Ante, at 24.\nWrong on both scores. As its name suggests, the condemnation power\ndoes not \u201ccompel\u201d anyone to do anything. It acts in rem, against the\nproperty that is condemned, and is effective with or without a transfer\nof title from the former owner. More important, the power to condemn\nfor public use is a separate sovereign power, explicitly acknowledged in\nthe Fifth Amendment, which provides that \u201cprivate property [shall not]\nbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d\n  Thus, the power to condemn tends to refute rather than support\nthe power to compel purchase of unwanted goods at a prescribed price:\nThe latter is rather like the power to condemn cash for public use. If it\nexisted, why would it not (like the condemnation power) be accompa-\nnied by a requirement of fair compensation for the portion of the\nexacted price that exceeds the goods\u2019 fair market value (here, the\ndifference between what the free market would charge for a health-\ninsurance policy on a young, healthy person with no pre-existing\nconditions, and the government-exacted community-rated premium)?\n16       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

Those differences make a very good argument\nby the dissent\u2019s own lights, since they show that the fail-\nure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to\npurchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare\nproblem that is (in the dissent\u2019s view) included among the\nunenumerated \u201cproblems\u201d that the Constitution author-\nizes the Federal Government to solve. But those differences\ndo not show that the failure to enter the health-insurance\nmarket, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is\nan activity that Congress can \u201cregulate.\u201d (Of course one\nday the failure of some of the public to purchase Amer-\nican cars may endanger the existence of domestic automo-\nbile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli\nmay be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer-\nfighting chemical which only that food contains, producing\nhealth-care costs that are a burden on the rest of us\u2014in\nwhich case, under the theory of JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s dis-\nsent, moving against those inactivities will also come\nwithin the Federal Government\u2019s unenumerated problem-\nsolving powers.)\n                            II\n                     The Taxing Power\n  As far as \u00a75000A is concerned, we would stop there.\nCongress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

The phrase \u201cindependently authorized\u201d\nsuggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen\nin the United States Reports: A penalty for constitutional\npurposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes. In\nall our cases the two are mutually exclusive. The provi-\nsion challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty\nor else a tax. Of course in many cases what was a regu-\nlatory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been\nimposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was im-\nposed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a\nregulatory mandate enforced by a penalty. But we know\nof no case, and the Government cites none, in which the\nimposition was, for constitutional purposes, both.5 The\ntwo are mutually exclusive. Thus, what the Government\u2019s\ncaption should have read was \u201cALTERNATIVELY, THE\nMINIMUM COVERAGE PROVISION IS NOT A MANDATE-WITH-\nPENALTY BUT A TAX.\u201d It is important to bear this in mind\nin evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of\nthose who support it: The issue is not whether Congress\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 No   one seriously contends that any of Congress\u2019 other enumerated\npowers gives it the authority to enact \u00a75000A as a regulation.\n   5 Of course it can be both for statutory purposes, since Congress can\n\ndefine \u201ctax\u201d and \u201cpenalty\u201d in its enactments any way it wishes. That is\nwhy United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268 (1978), does not disprove our\nstatement.

Section 5000A(e) then creates a sepa-\nrate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the\npenalty certain individuals who are subject to the mini-\nmum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford\ncoverage, \u00a75000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to re-\nquire filing a tax return, \u00a75000A(e)(2); who are members\nof an Indian tribe, \u00a75000A(e)(3); who experience only short\ngaps in coverage, \u00a75000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment\nof the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \u201chave\nsuffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain\ncoverage,\u201d \u00a75000A(e)(5). If \u00a75000A were a tax, these two\nclasses of exemption would make no sense; there being no\nrequirement, all the exemptions would attach to the pen-\nalty (renamed tax) alone.\n   In the face of all these indications of a regulatory re-\nquirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General\nassures us that \u201cneither the Treasury Department nor the\n22       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

These self-\nserving litigating positions are entitled to no weight.\nWhat counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely\nclear. It is worth noting, moreover, that these assurances\ncontradict the Government\u2019s position in related litigation.\nShortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the\nCommonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann. \u00a738.2\u2013\n3430.1:1 (Lexis Supp. 2011), which states, \u201cNo resident of\n[the] Commonwealth . . . shall be required to obtain or\nmaintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except\nas required by a court or the Department of Social Ser-\nvices . . . .\u201d In opposing Virginia\u2019s assertion of standing to\nchallenge \u00a75000A based on this statute, the Government\nsaid that \u201cif the minimum coverage provision is unconsti-\ntutional, the [Virginia] statute is unnecessary, and if the\nminimum coverage provision is upheld, the state statute is\nvoid under the Supremacy Clause.\u201d Brief for Appellant\nin No. 11\u20131057 etc. (CA4), p. 29. But it would be void\nunder the Supremacy Clause only if it was contradicted by\na federal \u201crequire[ment] to obtain or maintain a policy of\nindividual insurance coverage.\u201d\n  Against the mountain of evidence that the minimum\ncoverage requirement is what the statute calls it\u2014a re-\nquirement\u2014and that the penalty for its violation is what\nthe statute calls it\u2014a penalty\u2014the Government brings\nforward the flimsiest of indications to the contrary. It\nnotes that \u201c[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the\nInternal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted\nindividual . . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to\nthe income tax itself,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he [Internal Revenue\nService (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the\nsame manner as assessable penalties under the Internal\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

It is not.\nSee, e.g., 26 U. S. C. \u00a7527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible pen-\nalty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures);\n\u00a75761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of to-\nbacco products labeled for export); \u00a79707 (IRS-collectible\npenalty for failure to make required health-insurance\npremium payments on behalf of mining employees). In\nReorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S.\n213, we held that an exaction not only enforced by the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a \u201ctax\u201d\nwas in fact a penalty. \u201c[I]f the concept of penalty means\nanything,\u201d we said, \u201cit means punishment for an unlawful\nact or omission.\u201d Id., at 224. See also Lipke v. Lederer,\n259 U. S. 557 (1922) (same). Moreover, while the penalty\nis assessed and collected by the IRS, \u00a75000A is adminis-\ntered both by that agency and by the Department of\nHealth and Human Services (and also the Secretary of\nVeteran Affairs), see \u00a75000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v),\n(f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for\ndefining its substantive scope\u2014a feature that would be\nquite extraordinary for taxes.\n   The Government points out that \u201c[t]he amount of the\npenalty will be calculated as a percentage of household\nincome for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor\nand [a] ca[p],\u201d and that individuals who earn so little\nmoney that they \u201care not required to file income tax re-\nturns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty\u201d\n(though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the\nmandate).

C. \u00a72716a(a).\n  The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petition-\ners that we will address is the contention that what this\nstatute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it\ncontains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a\nrequirement suggests a penalty\u2014though one can imagine\na tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of\nsuch a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for\nabsolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a\nstatute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume\na mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a \u201csevere\npenalty.\u201d Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 618\n(1994). Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing\nwhen it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred\nfrom a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a\npenalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter\nrequirement.\n  And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and pen-\nalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core,\nrather than where a tax would be found\u2014in Title IX,\ncontaining the Act\u2019s \u201cRevenue Provisions.\u201d In sum, \u201cthe\nterms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,\u201d Parsons v.\nBedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a\nregulatory penalty, not a tax.\n  For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Man-\ndate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute\nbut to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubl-\ning. Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act\nof 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution\nrequires tax increases to originate in the House of Repre-\nsentatives. See Art. I, \u00a77, cl. 1. That is to say, they must\noriginate in the legislative body most accountable to the\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

The\nFederalist No. 58 \u201cdefend[ed] the decision to give the\norigination power to the House on the ground that the\nChamber that is more accountable to the people should\nhave the primary role in raising revenue.\u201d United States\nv. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 395 (1990). We have no\ndoubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing\nwhen it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that\nimposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. See\nAffordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th\nCong., 1st Sess., \u00a7501 (2009); America\u2019s Healthy Future\nAct of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a71301. Impos-\ning a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitu-\ntional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of\ngovernment least accountable to the citizenry.\n   Finally, we must observe that rewriting \u00a75000A as a tax\nin order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to\nconfront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is\na direct tax that must be apportioned among the States\naccording to their population. Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 4. Perhaps it\nis not (we have no need to address the point); but the\nmeaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and\nits application here is a question of first impression that\ndeserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-\na-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.\nThe Government\u2019s opening brief did not even address the\nquestion\u2014perhaps because, until today, no federal court\nhas accepted the implausible argument that \u00a75000A is\nan exercise of the tax power. And once respondents raised\nthe issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its\nreply brief to the issue. Petitioners\u2019 Minimum Coverage\nReply Brief 25.

S. C. \u00a77421(a) (2006 ed.).\n  We have left the question to this point because it\nseemed to us that the dispositive question whether the\nminimum-coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately\naddressed in the significant constitutional context of\nwhether it is an exercise of Congress\u2019 taxing power. Hav-\ning found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding\nthat these suits do not have \u201cthe purpose of restraining\nthe assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The amicus appointed to defend the proposition that the Anti-\n\nInjunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction stresses that the penalty for\nfailing to comply with the mandate \u201cshall be assessed and collected\nin the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of\nchapter 68,\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and that\nsuch penalties \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\nas taxes,\u201d \u00a76671(a) (2006 ed.). But that point seems to us to confirm\nthe inapplicability of the Anti-Injunction Act. That the penalty is to\nbe \u201cassessed and collected in the same manner as taxes\u201d refutes the\nproposition that it is a tax for all statutory purposes, including with\nrespect to the Anti-Injunction Act. Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal\nRevenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment\nshall be \u201cassessed and collected\u201d in the same manner as a tax and that\nno suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of\nthe payment. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a77421(b)(1), \u00a76901(a); \u00a76305(a), (b). The\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

The rhetorical device that\ntries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is\nthe same device employed in arguing that for constitu-\ntional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax:\nconfusing the question of what Congress did with the\nquestion of what Congress could have done. What quali-\nfies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike\nwhat qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is\nentirely within the control of Congress. Compare Bailey v.\nGeorge, 259 U. S. 16, 20 (1922) (Anti-Injunction Act barred\nsuit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax\nLaw), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S., at 36\u201341\n(holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Con-\ngress\u2019 taxing power). Congress could have defined \u201ctax\u201d\nfor purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude\nsome exactions that in fact are \u201ctaxes.\u201d It might have\nprescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the\ntaxing power \u201cshall not be regarded as a tax for purposes\nof the Anti-Injunction Act.\u201d But there is no such prescrip-\ntion here. What the Government would have us believe in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlatter directive would be superfluous if the former invoked the Anti-\nInjunction Act.\n  Amicus also suggests that the penalty should be treated as a tax\nbecause it is an assessable penalty, and the Code\u2019s assessment provi-\nsion authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess \u201call taxes (in-\ncluding interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and as-\nsessable penalties) imposed by this title.\u201d \u00a76201(a) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV). But the fact that such items are included as \u201ctaxes\u201d for purposes of\nassessment does not establish that they are included as \u201ctaxes\u201d for\npurposes of other sections of the Code, such as the Anti-Injunction Act,\nthat do not contain similar \u201cincluding\u201d language.\n28        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v.

For\nthe average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is\nequal to more than one-fifth of the State\u2019s expenditures.7\nA State forced out of the program would not only lose this\nhuge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to\nincrease its own health-care expenditures substantially,\nrequiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other\nprograms or a large increase in state taxes. And these\nnew taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already\npaid by the State\u2019s citizens to fund the Medicaid program\nin other States.\n  The States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA\u2019s\nMedicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical\nreasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at\nall.

C. \u00a718091(2)(D), and\nwithout 100% State participation in the Medicaid pro-\ngram, attainment of this goal would be thwarted. Even if\nStates could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program,\nwhile declining to participate in the Expansion, there\nwould be a gaping hole in coverage. And if a substantial\nnumber of States were entirely expelled from the program,\nthe number of persons without coverage would be even\nhigher.\n   In light of the ACA\u2019s goal of near-universal coverage,\npetitioners argue, if Congress had thought that anything\nless than 100% state participation was a realistic possibil-\nity, Congress would have provided a backup scheme. But\nno such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than\n900 pages of the Act. This shows, they maintain, that\nCongress was certain that the ACA\u2019s Medicaid offer was\none that no State could refuse.\n   In response to this argument, the Government contends\nthat any congressional assumption about uniform state\nparticipation was based on the simple fact that the offer\nof federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is\nsuch a generous gift that no State would want to turn it\ndown.\n   To evaluate these arguments, we consider the extent of\nthe Federal Government\u2019s power to spend money and to\nattach conditions to money granted to the States.\n                              A\n    No one has ever doubted that the Constitution author-\nizes the Federal Government to spend money, but for\nmany years the scope of this power was unsettled.

For one thing, any\nsuch conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at\nleast knows what it is getting into. See Pennhurst, supra,\nat 17.

See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U. S. 181, 186\n(2002); Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17. And just as a contract\nis voidable if coerced, \u201c[t]he legitimacy of Congress\u2019 power\nto legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether\nthe State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms\nof the \u2018contract.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

Congress may not \u201csimply commandeer the legisla-\ntive processes of the States by directly compelling them to\nenact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\u201d Id.,\nat 161 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\nCongress effectively engages in this impermissible com-\npulsion when state participation in a federal spending\nprogram is coerced, so that the States\u2019 choice whether to\nenact or administer a federal regulatory program is ren-\ndered illusory.\n   Where all Congress has done is to \u201cencourag[e] state\nregulation rather than compe[l] it, state governments\nremain responsive to the local electorate\u2019s preferences;\nstate officials remain accountable to the people. [But]\nwhere the Federal Government compels States to regulate,\nthe accountability of both state and federal officials is\ndiminished.\u201d New York, supra, at 168.\n   Amici who support the Government argue that forcing\nstate employees to implement a federal program is more\nrespectful of federalism than using federal workers to\nimplement that program. See, e.g., Brief for Service Em-\nployees International Union et al. as Amici Curiae in No.\n11\u2013398, pp. 25\u201326. They note that Congress, instead of\nexpanding Medicaid, could have established an entirely\nfederal program to provide coverage for the same group of\npeople. By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative\nfederal-state program, they contend, Congress allows for\nmore state control. Ibid.\n   This argument reflects a view of federalism that our\ncases have rejected\u2014and with good reason. When Con-\ngress compels the States to do its bidding, it blurs the\nlines of political accountability. If the Federal Govern-\nment makes a controversial decision while acting on its\nown, \u201cit is the Federal Government that makes the deci-\nsion in full view of the public, and it will be federal offi-\ncials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out\nto be detrimental or unpopular.\u201d New York, 505 U.

But when the Federal Government compels the\nStates to take unpopular actions, \u201cit may be state officials\nwho will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the\nfederal officials who devised the regulatory program may\nremain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their\ndecision.\u201d Id., at 169; see Printz, supra, at 930. For this\nreason, federal officeholders may view this \u201cdepartur[e]\nfrom the federal structure to be in their personal interests\n. . . as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual\ndecision.\u201d New York, 505 U. S., at 182\u2013183. And even state\nofficials may favor such a \u201cdeparture from the constitu-\ntional plan,\u201d since uncertainty concerning responsibility\nmay also permit them to escape accountability. Id., at\n182. If a program is popular, state officials may claim\ncredit; if it is unpopular, they may protest that they were\nmerely responding to a federal directive.\n    Once it is recognized that spending-power legislation\ncannot coerce state participation, two questions remain:\n(1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context? (2) Is\nthe ACA\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive? We now\nturn to those questions.\n                              D\n                              1\n  The answer to the first of these questions\u2014the meaning\nof coercion in the present context\u2014is straightforward. As\nwe have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions\nto federal grants to the States depends on the voluntari-\nness of the States\u2019 choice to accept or decline the offered\npackage. Therefore, if States really have no choice other\nthan to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the\nconditions cannot be sustained under the spending power.\nAnd as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear,\ntheoretical voluntariness is not enough.\n  In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the\nspending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the\n36      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

South Dakota ar-\ngued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we\ndisagreed, reasoning that \u201cCongress ha[d] directed only\nthat a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age\nlower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain\nfederal highway funds.\u201d 483 U. S., at 211. Because \u201call\nSouth Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen\ncourse as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5%\nof the funds otherwise obtainable under specified high-\nway grant programs,\u201d we found that \u201cCongress ha[d] of-\nfered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact\nhigher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise\nchoose.\u201d Ibid. Thus, the decision whether to comply with\nthe federal condition \u201cremain[ed] the prerogative of the\nStates not merely in theory but in fact,\u201d and so the pro-\ngram at issue did not exceed Congress\u2019 power. Id., at 211\u2013\n212 (emphasis added).\n  The question whether a law enacted under the spending\npower is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but\nwhere Congress has plainly \u201ccrossed the line distinguish-\ning encouragement from coercion,\u201d New York, supra, at\n175, a federal program that coopts the States\u2019 political\nprocesses must be declared unconstitutional. \u201c[T]he fed-\neral balance is too essential a part of our constitutional\nstructure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for\nus to admit inability to intervene.\u201d Lopez, 514 U. S., at\n578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n                              2\n   The Federal Government\u2019s argument in this case at best\npays lip service to the anticoercion principle. The Federal\nGovernment suggests that it is sufficient if States are\n\u201cfree, as a matter of law, to turn down\u201d federal funds.\nBrief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013400, p. 17 (emphasis\nadded); see also id., at 25.

Id., at 41\u201346.\n   This argument ignores reality. When a heavy federal\ntax is levied to support a federal program that offers large\ngrants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be\nunable to refuse to participate in the federal program and\nto substitute a state alternative. Even if a State believes\nthat the federal program is ineffective and inefficient,\nwithdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge\ntax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would\ncome on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents\nto support subsidies to participating States.13\n   Acceptance of the Federal Government\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dic-\ntate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the\nstate or local level. Suppose, for example, that Congress\nenacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the\nState\u2019s entire annual expenditures for primary and sec-\nondary education. Suppose also that this funding came\nwith conditions governing such things as school curricu-\nlum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of\nschool districts, the length and hours of the school day, the\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 JUSTICE GINSBURG argues that \u201c[a] State . . . has no claim on the\n\nmoney its residents pay in federal taxes.\u201d Ante, at 59, n. 26. This is\ntrue as a formal matter. \u201cWhen the United States Government taxes\nUnited States citizens, it taxes them \u2018in their individual capacities\u2019 as\n\u2018the people of America\u2019\u2014not as residents of a particular State.\u201d Ante, at\n58, n. 26 (quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,\n839 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring)). But unless JUSTICE GINSBURG\nthinks that there is no limit to the amount of money that can be\nsqueezed out of taxpayers, heavy federal taxation diminishes the\npractical ability of States to collect their own taxes.\n38       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

As a matter of law, a State could turn\ndown that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not\nonly be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support\nthis expensive new program, but they would also be forced\nto pay an equivalent amount in state taxes. And if the\nState gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivi-\nsions would surrender their traditional authority in the\nfield of education. Asked at oral argument whether such\na law would be allowed under the spending power, the\nSolicitor General responded that it would.

In this case, however, there\ncan be no doubt. In structuring the ACA, Congress unam-\nbiguously signaled its belief that every State would have\nno real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expan-\nsion. If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case,\nthen there is no such rule.\n                               1\n   The dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong\nsupport to the petitioner States\u2019 argument that refusing to\naccede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realis-\ntic option. Before the ACA\u2019s enactment, Medicaid funded\nmedical care for pregnant women, families with depend-\nents, children, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled. See\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).

Any State that refuses to expand\nits Medicaid programs in this way is threatened with a\nsevere sanction: the loss of all its federal Medicaid funds.\nSee \u00a71396c (2006 ed.).\n   Medicaid has long been the largest federal program of\ngrants to the States. See Brief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013\n400, at 37. In 2010, the Federal Government directed\nmore than $552 billion in federal funds to the States. See\nNat. Assn. of State Budget Officers, 2010 State Expendi-\nture Report: Examining Fiscal 2009\u20132011 State Spending,\np. 7 (2011) (NASBO Report). Of this, more than $233\nbillion went to pre-expansion Medicaid. See id., at 47.14\nThis amount equals nearly 22% of all state expenditures\ncombined.

Harry Reid et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11\u2013\n400, p. 21 (\u201cStates may always choose to decrease expendi-\ntures on other programs or to raise revenues\u201d). But the\nsheer size of this federal spending program in relation to\nstate expenditures means that a State would be very hard\npressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by\ncutting other spending or raising additional revenue.\nArizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expendi-\ntures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government\nto provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third\nof Arizona\u2019s annual state expenditures of $17 billion. See\nNASBO Report 7, 47. Therefore, if Arizona lost federal\nMedicaid funding, the State would have to commit an\nadditional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an\nequivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion\nMedicaid. This means that the State would have to allo-\ncate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.\nSee ibid.\n  The States are far less reliant on federal funding for any\nother program.

See ibid. In Arizona,\nfor example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are\nequal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education\nfunds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures. See\nibid. And even in States with less than average federal\nMedicaid funding, that funding is at least twice the size of\nfederal education funding as a percentage of state expend-\nitures. Id., at 7, 16, 47.\n   A State forced out of the Medicaid program would face\nburdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid fund-\ning. For example, a nonparticipating State might be found\nto be ineligible for other major federal funding sources,\nsuch as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),\nwhich is premised on the expectation that States will\nparticipate in Medicaid. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(3) (2006\ned.) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be\n\u201celigible for medical assistance under the State[\u2019s Medi-\ncaid] plan\u201d). And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medi-\ncaid program would not relieve a State\u2019s hospitals of their\nobligation under federal law to provide care for patients\nwho are unable to pay for medical services. The Emer-\ngency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, \u00a71395dd,\nrequires hospitals that receive any federal funding to\nprovide stabilization care for indigent patients but does\nnot offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out\nits mandate. Many of these patients are now covered by\nMedicaid. If providers could not look to the Medicaid\nprogram to pay for this care, they would find it exceed-\ningly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were\ngiven substantial state support. See, e.g., Brief for Econ-\nomists as Amici Curiae in No 11\u2013400, p. 11.\n   For these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the\nStates\u2014go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or\n42      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount\nthat the States would have lost if every single State\nhad refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking\nage was approximately $614.7 million\u2014or about 0.19%\nof all state expenditures combined.

South Dakota stood to lose, at most,\nfunding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state\nexpenditures. See ibid. Under the ACA, by contrast, the\nFederal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of\nall federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233\nbillion. See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47. South Dakota\nstands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual\nstate expenditures. See id., at 7, 47. Withholding $614.7\nmillion, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures\ncombined, is aptly characterized as \u201crelatively mild en-\ncouragement,\u201d but threatening to withhold $233 billion,\nequaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a\ndifferent matter.\n                              2\n  What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal\nand structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress\nclearly expressed its informed view that no State could\npossibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\n  The stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care\ncoverage. To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that\nevery person obtain a minimum level of coverage. It at-\ntempts to reach this goal in several different ways. The\nguaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are\ndesigned to make qualifying insurance available and\naffordable for persons with medical conditions that may\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             43\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nrequire expensive care. Other ACA provisions seek to\nmake such policies more affordable for people of modest\nmeans.     Finally, for low-income individuals who are\nsimply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded\nMedicaid, transforming it from a program covering only\nmembers of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a pro-\ngram that provides at least the requisite minimum level\nof coverage for the poor. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)\n(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 1396u\u20137(a), (b)(5),\n18022(a). This design was intended to provide at least\na specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans,\nbut the achievement of that goal obviously depends on\nparticipation by every single State. If any State\u2014not\nto mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit\u2014\nchose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping\nhole in the ACA\u2019s coverage.\n  It is true that some persons who are eligible for Medi-\ncaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private\ninsurance, either through their employers or by obtain-\ning subsidized insurance through an exchange. See 26\nU. S. C. \u00a736B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respond-\nents in No. 11\u2013400, at 12. But the new federal subsidies\nare not available to those whose income is below the fed-\neral poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other\nthan Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage\nand comply with the Mandate. The Government counters\nthat these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e.g.,\nTr. of Oral Arg. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents\nin No. 11\u2013400, at 49\u201350, but that argument misses the\npoint: Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have\ncoverage and the ACA\u2019s goal of near-universal coverage\nwill be severely frustrated.\n  If Congress had thought that States might actually\nrefuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Con-\ngress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that\nthe most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously\n44       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\neligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold. But\nnowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be\nfound. By contrast, because Congress thought that some\nStates might decline federal funding for the operation of\na \u201chealth benefit exchange,\u201d Congress provided a backup\nscheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation\nof an exchange, the Federal Government will step in\nand operate an exchange in that State. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718041(c)(1). Likewise, knowing that States would not\nnecessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens\nlawfully present in the United States\u2014because Medicaid\ndoes not require States to provide such coverage\u2014Con-\ngress extended the availability of the new federal insur-\nance subsidies to all aliens. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a736B(c)\n(1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals\nwho are \u201cnot eligible for the medicaid program . . . by\nreason of [their] alien status\u201d). Congress did not make\nthese subsidies available for citizens with incomes below\nthe poverty level because Congress obviously assumed\nthat they would be covered by Medicaid. If Congress had\ncontemplated that some of these citizens would be left\nwithout Medicaid coverage as a result of a State\u2019s with-\ndrawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely\nwould have made them eligible for the tax subsidies pro-\nvided for low-income aliens.\n   These features of the ACA convey an unmistakable\nmessage: Congress never dreamed that any State would\nrefuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid. Con-\ngress well understood that refusal was not a practical\noption.\n   The Federal Government does not dispute the inference\nthat Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it\nargues that this assumption was based on the fact that\nACA\u2019s offer was an \u201cexceedingly generous\u201d gift. Brief for\nRespondents in No. 11\u2013400, at 50. As the Federal Gov-\nernment sees things, Congress is like the generous bene-\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n            45\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nfactor who offers $1 million with few strings attached to\n50 randomly selected individuals. Just as this benefactor\nmight assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap\nup his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would\ngratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go\nwith the expansion of Medicaid.\n   This characterization of the ACA\u2019s offer raises obvious\nquestions. If that offer is \u201cexceedingly generous,\u201d as the\nFederal Government maintains, why have more than half\nthe States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer\nis coercive? And why did Congress find it necessary to\nthreaten that any State refusing to accept this \u201cexceed-\ningly generous\u201d gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds?\nCongress could have made just the new funding provided\nunder the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of\nthe Medicaid Expansion. Congress took such an approach\nin some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new\ncoverage requirements and funding from the rest of the\nprogram so that only new funding was conditioned on new\neligibility extensions. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-\nments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1465.\n   Congress\u2019 decision to do otherwise here reflects its un-\nderstanding that the ACA offer is not an \u201cexceedingly\ngenerous\u201d gift that no State in its right mind would de-\ncline. Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very\nsubstantial costs on participating States. It is true that\nthe Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs\nassociated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying\n100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals\nbetween 2014 and 2016. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(y). But that\nis just part of the picture. Participating States will be\nforced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after\n2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the\ncosts associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state\nspending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by\n2020 as a consequence.

After 2019,\nstate spending is expected to increase at a faster rate; the\nCBO estimates new state spending at $60 billion through\n2021. Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, supra, at 24.\nAnd these costs may increase in the future because of\nthe very real possibility that the Federal Government will\nchange funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds\nit will cover. This would leave the States to bear an in-\ncreasingly large percentage of the bill. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 74\u201376 (Mar. 28, 2012). Finally, after 2015, the States\nwill have to pick up the tab for 50% of all administrative\ncosts associated with implementing the new program, see\n\u00a7\u00a71396b(a)(2)\u2013(5), (7) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), costs that could\napproach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020,\nsee Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Medi-\ncaid and Medicare Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the\nFinancial Outlook for Medicaid 30.\n   In sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure\nof the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was\none that Congress understood no State could refuse. The\nMedicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress\u2019 spending\npower and cannot be implemented.\n                             F\n  Seven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid\nExpansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional.\nSee Part IV\u2013A to IV\u2013E, supra; Part IV\u2013A, ante, at 45\u201355\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J., joined by BREYER and KAGAN,\nJJ.). Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional,\nthe question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             47\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nwould be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However,\nthe Government proposes\u2014in two cursory sentences at\nthe very end of its brief\u2014preserving the Expansion. Under\nits proposal, States would receive the additional Medi-\ncaid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would\nkeep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not\nexpand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government\u2019s\nsuggestion.\n   The reality that States were given no real choice but to\nexpand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed\nStates would have no choice, and the ACA depends on\nStates\u2019 having no choice, because its Mandate requires\nlow-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them\ncan afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Fur-\nthermore, a State\u2019s withdrawal might subject everyone in\nthe State to much higher insurance premiums. That is\nbecause the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the\ncost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA\u2019s in-\nsurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in\nmore detail in the severability section below. To make the\nMedicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA\u2019s structure\nand design \u201c \u2018would be to make a new law, not to enforce\nan old one. This is no part of our duty.\u2019 \u201d Trade-Mark\nCases, 100 U. S. 82, 99 (1879).\n   Worse, the Government\u2019s proposed remedy introduces a\nnew dynamic: States must choose between expanding\nMedicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for\nthe sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If\nthis divisive dynamic between and among States can be\nintroduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional\nchoice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not\ndoubt that States are capable of making decisions when\nput in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this\nCourt to put them there.\n   The Government cites a severability clause codified with\nMedicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating\n48        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n         SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nthat if \u201cany provision of this chapter, or the application\nthereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the\nremainder of the chapter, and the application of such\nprovision to other persons or circumstances shall not be\naffected thereby.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71303 (2006 ed.). But that\nclause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7\nshould not be invalidated if \u00a71396c, the authorization for\nthe cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional. It\ndoes not tell us that \u00a71396c can be judicially revised, to\nsay what it does not say. Such a judicial power would\nnot be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps\nthe doctrine of amendatory invalidation\u2014similar to the\namendatory veto that permits the Governors of some\nStates to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.\nThe proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that\nit would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but\nwould leave it up to the Court what the \u201cvalidated\u201d legis-\nlation will contain. The Court today opts for permitting\nthe cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it\nmight just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds\nthat represent no more than x percent of the State\u2019s bud-\nget. The Court severs nothing, but simply revises \u00a71396c to\nread as the Court would desire.\n   We should not accept the Government\u2019s invitation to\nattempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the\nMedicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it\nto retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds. Worse, the\nGovernment\u2019s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes\nthe ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a\ncourse for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has\nchosen; but under the Constitution, that power and au-\nthority do not rest with this Court.\n                           V\n                      Severability\n     The Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve \u201cnear-\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

The two pillars of the Act are the Individ-\nual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.\nIn our view, both these central provisions of the Act\u2014the\nIndividual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\u2014are invalid.\nIt follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provi-\nsions of the Act must fall as well. The following section\nexplains the severability principles that require this con-\nclusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated\nthe Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial\nusurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for\nwithdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV\u2013F, supra,\nwhich is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act\nalters its dynamics.\n                                A\n   When an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a\nmore comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the\nvalidity of the remaining provisions. The Court\u2019s author-\nity to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been\nwell established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137\n(1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provi-\nsion from the Judiciary Act of 1789. And while the Court\nhas sometimes applied \u201cat least a modest presumption in\nfavor of . . . severability,\u201d C. Nelson, Statutory Interpreta-\ntion 144 (2010), it has not always done so, see, e.g., Minne-\nsota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U. S.\n172, 190\u2013195 (1999).\n   An automatic or too cursory severance of statutory\nprovisions risks \u201crewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an\neffect altogether different from that sought by the meas-\nure viewed as a whole.\u201d Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton\nR. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 362 (1935).

That\ncan be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than\nstriking the whole statute and allowing Congress to ad-\ndress the conditions that pertained when the statute was\nconsidered at the outset.\n   The Court has applied a two-part guide as the frame-\nwork for severability analysis. The test has been deemed\n\u201cwell established.\u201d Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480\nU. S. 678, 684 (1987). First, if the Court holds a statutory\nprovision unconstitutional, it then determines whether\nthe now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con-\ngress intended. If not, the remaining provisions must be\ninvalidated. See id., at 685. In Alaska Airlines, the Court\nclarified that this first inquiry requires more than ask-\ning whether \u201cthe balance of the legislation is incapable of\nfunctioning independently.\u201d Id., at 684. Even if the re-\nmaining provisions will operate in some coherent way,\nthat alone does not save the statute. The question is\nwhether the provisions will work as Congress intended.\nThe \u201crelevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether\nthe statute will function in a manner consistent with\nthe intent of Congress.\u201d Id., at 685 (emphasis in original).\nSee also Free Enterprise Fund v.

Under the\nseverability test set out above, it must be determined if\nthose provisions function in a coherent way and as Con-\ngress would have intended, even when the major provi-\nsions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid\nExpansion are themselves invalid.\n   Congress did not intend to establish the goal of near-\nuniversal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.\nSee, e.g., ACA \u00a71563, 124 Stat. 270 (\u201c[T]his Act will reduce\nthe Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019\u201d). And it did\nnot intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one indus-\ntry or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act\nis to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set\nof regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to\nobtain health insurance. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(a). Insur-\nance companies are required to sell them insurance re-\ngardless of patients\u2019 pre-existing conditions and to comply\nwith a host of other regulations.

Some persons\nwho cannot afford insurance are provided it through the\nMedicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their pur-\nchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on\nhealth-insurance exchanges.

C. \u00a718071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV)\n(federal subsidies). The Federal Government\u2019s increased\nspending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal\nexpenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in\nfederal payments to hospitals. See, e.g., \u00a71395ww(r) (Med-\nicare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, 124 Stat. 847 (\u201cRev-\nenue Offset Provisions\u201d). Employers with at least 50\nemployees must either provide employees with adequate\nhealth benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee\nwho qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance\nthrough an exchange. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a74980H (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV).\n   In short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal\nhealth insurance coverage by spreading its costs to indi-\nviduals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers\u2014\nwhile, at the same time, offsetting significant portions\nof those costs with new benefits to each group. For ex-\nample, the Federal Government bears the burden of pay-\ning billions for the new entitlements mandated by the\nMedicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance\npurchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reduc-\ntions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals. Hospi-\ntals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the\ndecrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance\nregulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing\nconditions to purchase coverage that increases payments\nto hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed\nby a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including\n\u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating\u201d requirements\nto give coverage regardless of the insured\u2019s pre-existing\nconditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy\npurchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate\nto buy the insurers\u2019 product and from the new low-\nincome Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance\ncompanies\u2019 Medicaid-funded managed care programs.

So, the Act\u2019s major provisions\nare interdependent.\n  The Act then refers to these interdependencies as\n\u201cshared responsibility.\u201d See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, 124\nStat. 242 (\u201cShared Responsibility\u201d); ACA \u00a71501, ibid.\n(same); ACA \u00a71513, id., at 253 (same); ACA \u00a74980H, ibid.\n(same).

To be sure, an argument\ncan be made that those portions of the Act that none of the\nparties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonse-\nverable. The response to this argument is that our cases\ndo not support it. See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co.\nof La., 278 U. S. 235, 242\u2013244 (1929) (holding nonsever-\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

It would take years, perhaps\ndecades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated sepa-\nrately\u2014and for some of them (those simply expending\nfederal funds) no one may have separate standing. The\nFederal Government, the States, and private parties ought\nto know at once whether the entire legislation fails.\n   The opinion now explains in Part V\u2013C\u20131, infra, why the\nAct\u2019s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate\nand Medicaid Expansion. It proceeds from the insurance\nregulations and taxes (C\u20131\u2013a), to the reductions in reim-\nbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions\n(C\u20131\u2013b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C\u20131\u2013c),\nand the employer responsibility assessment (C\u20131\u2013d).\nPart V\u2013C\u20132, infra, explains why the Act\u2019s minor provi-\nsions also are not severable.\n                             1\n               The Act\u2019s Major Provisions\n  Major provisions of the Affordable Care Act\u2014i.e., the\ninsurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal\nreimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spend-\ning reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies,\nand the employer responsibility assessment\u2014cannot remain\nonce the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are\ninvalid. That result follows from the undoubted inability\nof the other major provisions to operate as Congress in-\ntended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid\nExpansion. Absent the invalid portions, the other major\nprovisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected bur-\ndens on patients, the health-care community, and the\nfederal budget. That consequence would be in absolute\nconflict with the ACA\u2019s design of \u201cshared responsibility,\u201d\nand would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did\n56       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                    BUSINESS v.

See Brief\nfor Economists as Amici Curiae in No. 11\u2013393 etc. (Sever-\nability), pp. 9\u201316, 10a.\n   If that analysis is correct, the regulations and taxes will\nmean higher costs for insurance companies. Higher costs\nmay mean higher premiums for consumers, despite the\nAct\u2019s goal of \u201clower[ing] health insurance premiums.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Higher costs\nalso could threaten the survival of health-insurance com-\npanies, despite the Act\u2019s goal of \u201ceffective health insurance\nmarkets.\u201d \u00a718091(2)(J).\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n            57\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\n   The actual cost of the regulations and taxes may be\nmore or less than predicted. What is known, however, is\nthat severing other provisions from the Individual Man-\ndate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose\nsignificant risks and real uncertainties on insurance com-\npanies, their customers, all other major actors in the sys-\ntem, and the government treasury. And what also is\nknown is this: Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertain-\nties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability\nand thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the\nNation\u2019s freedom. If those risks and uncertainties are to\nbe imposed, it must not be by the Judiciary.\n                             b\n   Reductions in Reimbursements to Hospitals and\n      Other Reductions in Medicare Expenditures\n  The Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Fed-\neral Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion\nover 10 years. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)\u2013(xii)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV); \u00a71395ww(q); \u00a71395ww(r); \u00a71396r\u2013\n4(f)(7).\n  The concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage\nwill reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hos-\npitals\u2019 revenues, which will offset the government\u2019s re-\nductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to\nhospitals. Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and\nbenefits balance each other. This is typical of the whole\ndynamic of the Act.\n  Invalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insur-\nance coverage, such as community rating and the Medi-\ncaid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in\nMedicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA\u2019s design of\n\u201cshared responsibility.\u201d Some hospitals may be forced to\nraise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in\nreimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance\npremiums, in contravention of the Act\u2019s goal of \u201clower[ing]\n58       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nhealth insurance premiums.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(F)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV). See also \u00a718091(2)(I) (goal of\n\u201clower[ing] health insurance premiums\u201d); \u00a718091(2)(J)\n(same). Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that\nserve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced\nto shut down. Cf. National Assn. of Public Hospitals, 2009\nAnnual Survey: Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems\nFulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5\u20136 (Feb. 2011). Like\nthe effect of preserving the insurance regulations and\ntaxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknow-\nable. It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing\npart of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose\nunknowable risks that Congress could neither measure\nnor predict. And Congress could not have intended that\nresult in any event.\n   There is a second, independent reason why the reduc-\ntions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA\u2019s other\nMedicare cuts must be invalidated. The ACA\u2019s $455 bil-\nlion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434-\nbillion cost of the Medicaid Expansion. See CBO Esti-\nmate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed\nCongress to find that the ACA \u201cwill reduce the Federal\ndeficit between 2010 and 2019\u201d and \u201cwill continue to\nreduce budget deficits after 2019.\u201d ACA \u00a7\u00a71563(a)(1), (2),\n124 Stat. 270.\n   That finding was critical to the ACA. The Act\u2019s \u201cshared\nresponsibility\u201d concept extends to the federal budget.\nCongress chose to offset new federal expenditures with\nbudget cuts and tax increases. That is why the United\nStates has explained in the course of this litigation that\n\u201c[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure\nthat any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was\noffset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provi-\nsions.\u201d Memorandum in Support of Government\u2019s Motion\nfor Summary Judgment in No. 3\u201310\u2013cv\u201391, p. 41.\n   If the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

They would lose their justification and\nfoundation. In addition, to preserve them would be \u201cto\neliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative com-\npromise\u201d and create a statute Congress did not enact.\nLegal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,\n561 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It is no secret that\ncutting Medicare is unpopular; and it is most improbable\nCongress would have done so without at least the assur-\nance that it would render the ACA deficit-neutral. See\nACA \u00a7\u00a71563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.\n                              c\n   Health Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal\n                         Subsidies\n  The ACA requires each State to establish a health-\ninsurance \u201cexchange.\u201d Each exchange is a one-stop mar-\nketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare\ncommunity-rated health insurance and purchase the\npolicy of their choice. The exchanges cannot operate in the\nmanner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate,\nMedicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot\nremain in force.\n  The Act\u2019s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars\nto subsidize individuals\u2019 purchases on the exchanges. In-\ndividuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of\nthe poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of\ninsurance to the individual purchaser. 26 U. S. C. \u00a736B\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. \u00a718071 (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV). By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will\nobtain insurance through an exchange are expected to\nreceive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.\nSee CBO, Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation\nEnacted in March 2010, pp. 18\u201319 (Mar. 30, 2011). With-\nout the community-rating insurance regulation, however,\n60      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nthe average federal subsidy could be much higher; for\ncommunity rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums\nunhealthy individuals would otherwise pay.          Federal\nsubsidies would make up much of the difference.\n   The result would be an unintended boon to insurance\ncompanies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and\na corresponding breakdown of the \u201cshared responsibil-\nity\u201d between the industry and the federal budget that\nCongress intended. Thus, the federal subsidies must be\ninvalidated.\n   In the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insur-\nance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance\non the exchanges. Under the ACA\u2019s scheme, few, if any,\nindividuals would want to buy individual insurance poli-\ncies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies\nwould be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in\nattracting individuals outside of the exchange would in\nturn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the\nexchanges\u2019 onerous regulations. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718031.\nThat system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies\nare invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individ-\nuals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance\ninside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling\nto offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers\nand even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate\nas Congress intended and may not operate at all.\n   There is a second reason why, if community rating is\ninvalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\u2019s\ninvalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner\nconsistent with the Act\u2019s design. A key purpose of an\nexchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options\nwhere prices are standardized regardless of the buy-\ner\u2019s pre-existing conditions. See ibid. An individual who\nshops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate\ndifferent insurance products. The products will offer\ndifferent benefits and prices. Congress designed the ex-\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n            61\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nchanges so the shopper can compare benefits and prices.\nBut the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress\ndesigned if the prices depend on the shopper\u2019s pre-existing\nhealth conditions. The prices would vary from person to\nperson. So without community rating\u2014which prohibits\ninsurers from basing the price of insurance on pre-existing\nconditions\u2014the exchanges cannot operate in the manner\nCongress intended.\n                              d\n          Employer-Responsibility Assessment\n  The employer responsibility assessment provides an\nincentive for employers with at least 50 employees to\nprovide their employees with health insurance options\nthat meet minimum criteria. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a74980H\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV). Unlike the Individual Mandate,\nthe employer-responsibility assessment does not require\nemployers to provide an insurance option. Instead, it re-\nquires them to make a payment to the Federal Govern-\nment if they do not offer insurance to employees and if\ninsurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who\nqualifies for the exchange\u2019s federal subsidies. See ibid.\n  For two reasons, the employer-responsibility assessment\nmust be invalidated. First, the ACA makes a direct link\nbetween the employer-responsibility assessment and the\nexchanges. The financial assessment against employers\noccurs only under certain conditions. One of them is the\npurchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange.\nWith no exchanges, there are no purchases on the ex-\nchanges; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is\nnothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.\n  Second, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals\n(the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regu-\nlations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the\nFederal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges\nand for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reduc-\n62       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\ntions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employer-\nresponsibility assessment would upset the ACA\u2019s design\nof \u201cshared responsibility.\u201d It would leave employers as the\nonly parties bearing any significant responsibility. That\nwas not the congressional intent.\n                                2\n                The Act\u2019s Minor Provisions\n    The next question is whether the invalidation of the\nACA\u2019s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate\nthe ACA\u2019s other provisions. It does.\n    The ACA is over 900 pages long. Its regulations include\nrequirements ranging from a break time and secluded\nplace at work for nursing mothers, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7207(r)(1)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content\nat chain restaurants, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7343(q)(5)(H).\nThe Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, includ-\ning exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA\n\u00a7\u00a79015, 10906; HCERA \u00a71402, medical devices, see 26\nU. S. C. \u00a74191 (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and tanning booths,\nsee \u00a75000B. It spends government money on, among other\nthings, the study of how to spend less government money.\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71315a. And it includes a number of provisions\nthat provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator.\nFor example, \u00a710323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare\ncoverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in\nLibby, Montana. Another provision, \u00a72006, id., at 284,\nincreases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.\n    Such provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader\u2019s\nstatement, \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t know if there is a senator that doesn\u2019t\nhave something in this bill that was important to them.\n. . . [And] if they don\u2019t have something in it important to\nthem, then it doesn\u2019t speak well of them. That\u2019s what this\nlegislation is all about: It\u2019s the art of compromise.\u2019 \u201d Pear,\nIn Health Bill for Everyone, Provisions for a Few, N. Y.\nTimes, Jan. 4, 2010, p.

So, if the major provision were unconsti-\ntutional, Congress would not have passed the minor one.\n   Without the ACA\u2019s major provisions, many of these\nminor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress\nintended. For example, the tax increases are \u201cRevenue\nOffset Provisions\u201d designed to help offset the cost to the\nFederal Government of programs like the Medicaid Ex-\npansion and the exchanges\u2019 federal subsidies. See Title\nIX, Subtitle A\u2014Revenue Offset Provisions, 124 Stat. 847.\nWith the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invali-\ndated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs,\nand they no longer serve the purpose in the Act\u2019s scheme\nof \u201cshared responsibility\u201d that Congress intended.\n   Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to\ndisplay nutritional content, appear likely to operate as\nCongress intended, but they fail the second test for sever-\nability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would\nhave enacted them independently. The Court has not\npreviously had occasion to consider severability in the con-\ntext of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which in-\ncludes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its\ncentral provisions but also many that are entirely unre-\nlated\u2014hitched on because it was a quick way to get them\npassed despite opposition, or because their proponents\ncould exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their\nneeded support. When we are confronted with such a so-\ncalled \u201cChristmas tree,\u201d a law to which many nongermane\nornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule\nmust be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments\nare superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing\nwhich pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It\nis certain that many of them would not have, and it is not\na proper function of this Court to guess which. To sever\nthe statute in that manner \u201c \u2018would be to make a new law,\nnot to enforce an old one. This is not part of our duty.\u2019 \u201d\n64      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nTrade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S., at 99.\n  This Court must not impose risks unintended by Con-\ngress or produce legislation Congress may have lacked the\nsupport to enact. For those reasons, the unconstitution-\nality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid\nExpansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care\nAct\u2019s other provisions.\n                         *    *     *\n   The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did\nnot write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a\nrequirement with a penalty is instead an option subject\nto a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanc-\ntion of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly\nnoncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the\nAct makes available.\n   The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation\nas judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast\njudicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable\nversion of health-care regulation that Congress did not\nenact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment\nof sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since\nCongress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of\ndeparture a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions\nthat certain interests favored under the Court\u2019s new de-\nsign will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and\nthe States to expend vast sums of money on requirements\nthat may or may not survive the necessary congressional\nrevision.\n   The Court\u2019s disposition, invented and atextual as it is,\ndoes not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional\ndifficulties. It creates them. The holding that the Indi-\nvidual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional\nquestion (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves\nwith inadequate deliberation.

If that destabilizing political dynamic, so\nantagonistic to a harmonious Union, is to be introduced at\nall, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.\n   The values that should have determined our course to-\nday are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that\nthe Federal Government is one of limited powers. But\nthe Court\u2019s ruling undermines those values at every turn.\nIn the name of restraint, it overreaches. In the name of\nconstitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional\nquestions. In the name of cooperative federalism, it un-\ndermines state sovereignty.\n   The Constitution, though it dates from the founding of\nthe Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance\nto our own times. The constitutional protections that this\ncase involves are protections of structure. Structural\nprotections\u2014notably, the restraints imposed by federalism\nand separation of powers\u2014are less romantic and have less\nobvious a connection to personal freedom than the provi-\nsions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments.\nHence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by\nour citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to\nteach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers\nconsidered structural protections of freedom the most im-\nportant ones, for which reason they alone were embod-\nied in the original Constitution and not left to later\namendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the\nstructure of our Government is central to liberty, and\nwhen we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today\u2019s\ndecision should have vindicated, should have taught, this\ntruth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.\n   For the reasons here stated, we would find the Act in-\nvalid in its entirety.

SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF \n\n        HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 11\u2013393.      Argued March 26, 27, 28, 2012\u2014Decided June 28, 2012*\nIn 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\n  Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health\n  insurance and decrease the cost of health care. One key provision is\n  the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain\n  \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage. 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A.\n  For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health\n  insurance through an employer or government program, the means of\n  satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private\n  company. Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the\n  mandate must make a \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d to the Fed-\n  eral Government. \u00a75000A(b)(1). The Act provides that this \u201cpenalty\u201d\n  will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual\u2019s tax-\n  es, and \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\u201d as tax\n  penalties. \u00a7\u00a75000A(c), (g)(1).\n    Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion. The\n  current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist\n  pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and\n  the disabled in obtaining medical care. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(a). The\n  Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and\n  increases the number of individuals the States must cover. For ex-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u2013398, Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices et al. v. Florida et al., and No. 11\u2013400, Florida et al. v. Department\nof Health and Human Services et al., also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    ample, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage\n    by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal pov-\n    erty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only\n    if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults\n    at all. \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The Act increases federal funding to\n    cover the States\u2019 costs in expanding Medicaid coverage. \u00a71396d(y)(1).\n    But if a State does not comply with the Act\u2019s new coverage require-\n    ments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those require-\n    ments, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. \u00a71396c.\n       Twenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federa-\n    tion of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court,\n    challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the\n    Medicaid expansion. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\n    upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s\n    spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to en-\n    act the individual mandate. Finding the mandate severable from the\n    Act\u2019s other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act in-\n    tact.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n648 F. 3d 1235, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n    1. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with\n  respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not\n  bar this suit.\n    The Anti-Injunction Act provides that \u201cno suit for the purpose of\n  restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be main-\n  tained in any court by any person,\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77421(a), so that those\n  subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund. The pre-\n  sent challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsi-\n  bility payment from those who do not comply with the individual\n  mandate. But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as\n  a \u201ctax\u201d for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. The Affordable Care\n  Act describes the payment as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d not a \u201ctax.\u201d That label\n  cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Con-\n  stitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction\n  Act. The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit. Pp. 11\u2013\n  15.\n    2. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III\u2013A that the indi-\n  vidual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the\n  Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Pp. 16\u201330.\n       (a) The Constitution grants Congress the power to \u201cregulate\n  Commerce.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power to regulate\n  commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be reg-\n  ulated. This Court\u2019s precedent reflects this understanding: As ex-\n  pansive as this Court\u2019s cases construing the scope of the commerce\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\npower have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching \u201cac-\ntivity.\u201d E.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 560. The individ-\nual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activi-\nty. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by\npurchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects\ninterstate commerce.\n   Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate\nindividuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a\nnew and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Con-\ngress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.\nUpholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause\nwould give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not\ndo. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and\ndoing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce,\nnot to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the prin-\nciple that the Federal Government is a government of limited and\nenumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sus-\ntained under Congress\u2019s power to \u201cregulate Commerce.\u201d Pp. 16\u201327.\n      (b) Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Nec-\nessary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care\nAct\u2019s other reforms. Each of this Court\u2019s prior cases upholding laws\nunder that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and\nin service to, a granted power. E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560\nU. S. ___. The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with\nthe extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the ex-\nercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope\nthose who would otherwise be outside of it. Even if the individual\nmandate is \u201cnecessary\u201d to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s other reforms,\nsuch an expansion of federal power is not a \u201cproper\u201d means for mak-\ning those reforms effective. Pp. 27\u201330.\n   3. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III\u2013B that the individ-\nual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do\nnot have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.\n   The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that\nit commands individuals to purchase insurance. But, for the reasons\nexplained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.\nIt is therefore necessary to turn to the Government\u2019s alternative ar-\ngument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress\u2019s power\nto \u201clay and collect Taxes.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. In pressing its taxing\npower argument, the Government asks the Court to view the man-\ndate as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product. Be-\ncause \u201cevery reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to\nsave a statute from unconstitutionality,\u201d Hooper v. California, 155\nU. S. 648, 657, the question is whether it is \u201cfairly possible\u201d to inter-\n4            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    pret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 285\n    U. S. 22, 62. Pp. 31\u201332.\n       4. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with\n    respect to Part III\u2013C, concluding that the individual mandate may be\n    upheld as within Congress\u2019s power under the Taxing Clause. Pp. 33\u2013\n    44.\n          (a) The Affordable Care Act describes the \u201c[s]hared responsibility\n    payment\u201d as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d not a \u201ctax.\u201d That label is fatal to the appli-\n    cation of the Anti-Injunction Act. It does not, however, control\n    whether an exaction is within Congress\u2019s power to tax. In answering\n    that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach,\n    \u201c[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its sub-\n    stance and application.\u201d United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287,\n    294. Pp. 33\u201335.\n          (b) Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility\n    payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax. The\n    payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health\n    insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penal-\n    ties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by\n    the IRS through the normal means of taxation. Cf. Bailey v. Drexel\n    Furniture Co., 259 U. S. 20, 36\u201337. None of this is to say that pay-\n    ment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance. But\n    the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is un-\n    lawful. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches\n    negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond\n    requiring a payment to the IRS. And Congress\u2019s choice of language\u2014\n    stating that individuals \u201cshall\u201d obtain insurance or pay a \u201cpenalty\u201d\u2014\n    does not require reading \u00a75000A as punishing unlawful conduct. It\n    may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insur-\n    ance. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 169\u2013174.\n    Pp. 35\u201340.\n          (c) Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a\n    tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides:\n    \u201cNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion\n    to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\u201d\n    Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 4. A tax on going without health insurance is not like a\n    capitation or other direct tax under this Court\u2019s precedents. It there-\n    fore need not be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to\n    its population. Pp. 40\u201341.\n       5. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, joined by JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE\n    KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that the Medicaid expansion violates\n    the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing\n    Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.\n    Pp. 45\u201358.\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (a) The Spending Clause grants Congress the power \u201cto pay the\nDebts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. Congress may use this power to establish cooperative\nstate-federal Spending Clause programs. The legitimacy of Spending\nClause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily\nand knowingly accepts the terms of such programs. Pennhurst State\nSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17. \u201c[T]he Constitu-\ntion simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States\nto regulate.\u201d New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 178. When\nCongress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressur-\ning the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation\nruns counter to this Nation\u2019s system of federalism. Cf. South Dakota\nv. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211. Pp. 45\u201351.\n      (b) Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-\nvices the authority to penalize States that choose not to participate in\nthe Medicaid expansion by taking away their existing Medicaid fund-\ning. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c. The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a\nState\u2019s overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States\nwith no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion. The\nGovernment claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a\nmodification of the existing program, and that this modification is\npermissible because Congress reserved the \u201cright to alter, amend, or\nrepeal any provision\u201d of Medicaid. \u00a71304. But the expansion accom-\nplishes a shift in kind, not merely degree. The original program was\ndesigned to cover medical services for particular categories of vulner-\nable individuals. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is trans-\nformed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire\nnonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty\nlevel. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress\u2019s reservation of\nthe right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the Medicaid program included the\npower to transform it so dramatically. The Medicaid expansion thus\nviolates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their\nexisting Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expan-\nsion. Pp. 51\u201355.\n      (c) The constitutional violation is fully remedied by precluding\nthe Secretary from applying \u00a71396c to withdraw existing Medicaid\nfunds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the ex-\npansion. See \u00a71303. The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act\nare not affected. Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to\nstand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether\nto participate in the Medicaid expansion. Pp. 55\u201358.\n   6. JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, is of the view\nthat the Spending Clause does not preclude the Secretary from with-\nholding Medicaid funds based on a State\u2019s refusal to comply with the\n6            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    expanded Medicaid program. But given the majority view, she\n    agrees with THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s conclusion in Part IV\u2013B that the\n    Medicaid Act\u2019s severability clause, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71303, determines the\n    appropriate remedy. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the withhold-\n    ing\u2014not the granting\u2014of federal funds incompatible with the Spend-\n    ing Clause, Congress\u2019 extension of Medicaid remains available to any\n    State that affirms its willingness to participate. Even absent \u00a71303\u2019s\n    command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding\n    offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down\n    the ACA in its entirety. When a court confronts an unconstitutional\n    statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.\n    See, e.g., Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546\n    U. S. 320, 328\u2013330. Pp. 60\u201361.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

We ask only whether\nCongress has the power under the Constitution to enact\nthe challenged provisions.\n  In our federal system, the National Government pos-\nsesses only limited powers; the States and the people\nretain the remainder. Nearly two centuries ago, Chief\nJustice Marshall observed that \u201cthe question respecting\nthe extent of the powers actually granted\u201d to the Federal\nGovernment \u201cis perpetually arising, and will probably\ncontinue to arise, as long as our system shall exist.\u201d\nMcCulloch v.

In this\ncase we must again determine whether the Constitution\ngrants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many\nStates and individuals believe it does not possess. Resolv-\ning this controversy requires us to examine both the limits\nof the Government\u2019s power, and our own limited role in\npolicing those boundaries.\n  The Federal Government \u201cis acknowledged by all to\nbe one of enumerated powers.\u201d Ibid. That is, rather\nthan granting general authority to perform all the conceiv-\nable functions of government, the Constitution lists, or\nenumerates, the Federal Government\u2019s powers.

These\naffirmative prohibitions come into play, however, only where\nthe Government possesses authority to act in the first\nplace. If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to\npass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it\nwould not violate any of the express prohibitions in the\nBill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution.\n   Indeed, the Constitution did not initially include a Bill\nof Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enu-\nmeration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government.\nAs Alexander Hamilton put it, \u201cthe Constitution is itself,\nin every rational sense, and to every useful purpose,\nA BILL OF RIGHTS.\u201d The Federalist No. 84, p. 515 (C. Ros-\nsiter ed. 1961). And when the Bill of Rights was ratified,\nit made express what the enumeration of powers neces-\nsarily implied: \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United\nStates by the Constitution . . . are reserved to the States\nrespectively, or to the people.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.\nThe Federal Government has expanded dramatically over\nthe past two centuries, but it still must show that a consti-\ntutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions. See,\ne.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).\n   The same does not apply to the States, because the Con-\nstitution is not the source of their power. The Consti-\ntution may restrict state governments\u2014as it does, for\nexample, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal\nprotection of the laws. But where such prohibitions do\nnot apply, state governments do not need constitutional au-\nthorization to act. The States thus can and do perform\nmany of the vital functions of modern government\u2014\npunishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning\nproperty for development, to name but a few\u2014even though\n4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe Constitution\u2019s text does not authorize any government\nto do so. Our cases refer to this general power of govern-\ning, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Gov-\nernment, as the \u201cpolice power.\u201d See, e.g., United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618\u2013619 (2000).\n   \u201cState sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather,\nfederalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from\nthe diffusion of sovereign power.\u201d New York v. United\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 181 (1992) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because the police power is controlled by\n50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the\nfacets of governing that touch on citizens\u2019 daily lives are\nnormally administered by smaller governments closer to\nthe governed. The Framers thus ensured that powers\nwhich \u201cin the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives,\nliberties, and properties of the people\u201d were held by gov-\nernments more local and more accountable than a dis-\ntant federal bureaucracy. The Federalist No. 45, at 293\n(J. Madison). The independent power of the States also\nserves as a check on the power of the Federal Government:\n\u201cBy denying any one government complete jurisdiction\nover all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the\nliberty of the individual from arbitrary power.\u201d Bond v.\nUnited States, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\u201310).\n   This case concerns two powers that the Constitution\ndoes grant the Federal Government, but which must be\nread carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority\nakin to the police power. The Constitution authorizes\nCongress to \u201cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and\namong the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3. Our precedents read that to mean that\nCongress may regulate \u201cthe channels of interstate com-\nmerce,\u201d \u201cpersons or things in interstate commerce,\u201d and\n\u201cthose activities that substantially affect interstate com-\nmerce.\u201d Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).

J.\n\naffect interstate commerce can be expansive. That power\nhas been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem-\ningly local matters as a farmer\u2019s decision to grow wheat\nfor himself and his livestock, and a loan shark\u2019s extor-\ntionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop.\nSee Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Perez v.\nUnited States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971).\n   Congress may also \u201clay and collect Taxes, Duties, Im-\nposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the\ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United\nStates.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. Put simply, Con-\ngress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal\nGovernment considerable influence even in areas where\nit cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may\nenact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid,\nor otherwise control. See, e.g., License Tax Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/s7z/license-tax-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 471 (1867). And in exercising its spending power,\nCongress may offer funds to the States, and may condition\nthose offers on compliance with specified conditions. See,\ne.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecond-\nary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 686 (1999). These\noffers may well induce the States to adopt policies that\nthe Federal Government itself could not impose. See, e.g.,\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 205\u2013206 (1987) (con-\nditioning federal highway funds on States raising their\ndrinking age to 21).\n   The reach of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated\npowers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes\nCongress to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. We have long read this provision to give\nCongress great latitude in exercising its powers: \u201cLet the\nend be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitu-\ntion, and all means which are appropriate, which are\nplainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but\nconsist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are\n6        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v.

Those decisions\nare entrusted to our Nation\u2019s elected leaders, who can be\nthrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is\nnot our job to protect the people from the consequences of\ntheir political choices.\n   Our deference in matters of policy cannot, however,\nbecome abdication in matters of law. \u201cThe powers of the\nlegislature are defined and limited; and that those lim-\nits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is\nwritten.\u201d Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).\nOur respect for Congress\u2019s policy judgments thus can\nnever extend so far as to disavow restraints on federal\npower that the Constitution carefully constructed. \u201cThe\npeculiar circumstances of the moment may render a\nmeasure more or less wise, but cannot render it more or\nless constitutional.\u201d Chief Justice John Marshall, A\nFriend of the Constitution No. V, Alexandria Gazette, July\n5, 1819, in John Marshall\u2019s Defense of McCulloch v.

The Act aims to in-\ncrease the number of Americans covered by health in-\nsurance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act\u2019s 10\ntitles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of\nprovisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to\ntwo key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual\nmandate and the Medicaid expansion.\n   The individual mandate requires most Americans to\nmaintain \u201cminimum essential\u201d health insurance coverage.\n26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A. The mandate does not apply to some\nindividuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.\n\u00a75000A(d). Many individuals will receive the required cov-\nerage through their employer, or from a government pro-\ngram such as Medicaid or Medicare. See \u00a75000A(f). But\nfor individuals who are not exempt and do not receive\nhealth insurance through a third party, the means of\nsatisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a\nprivate company.\n   Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the\nmandate must make a \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d\nto the Federal Government. \u00a75000A(b)(1). That payment,\nwhich the Act describes as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d is calculated as a\npercentage of household income, subject to a floor based on\na specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the aver-\nage annual premium the individual would have to pay for\nqualifying private health insurance. \u00a75000A(c). In 2016,\nfor example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ-\nual\u2019s household income, but no less than $695 and no more\nthan the average yearly premium for insurance that co-\nvers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g.,\nprescription drugs and hospitalization). Ibid.; 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718022.

Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individ-\nual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear\neffect on interstate commerce.\n   Having held the individual mandate to be unconstitu-\ntional, the majority examined whether that provision\ncould be severed from the remainder of the Act. The ma-\njority determined that, contrary to the District Court\u2019s\nview, it could. The court thus struck down only the indi-\nvidual mandate, leaving the Act\u2019s other provisions intact.\n648 F. 3d, at 1328.\n   Other Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to\nthe individual mandate. The Sixth Circuit and the D. C.\nCircuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Con-\ngress\u2019s commerce power. See Thomas More Law Center v.\nObama, 651 F. 3d 529 (CA6 2011); Seven-Sky v. Holder,\n661 F. 3d 1 (CADC 2011). The Fourth Circuit determined\nthat the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from consid-\nering the merits of that question. See Liberty Univ., Inc.\nv. Geithner, 671 F. 3d 391 (2011). That statute bars suits\n\u201cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection\nof any tax.\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a77421(a). A majority of the Fourth\nCircuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate\u2019s\npenalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction\nAct, because it is a financial assessment collected by the\nIRS through the normal means of taxation. The majority\ntherefore determined that the plaintiffs could not chal-\nlenge the individual mandate until after they paid the\npenalty.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Eleventh Circuit did not consider whether the Anti-Injunction\n\nAct bars challenges to the individual mandate. The District Court had\ndetermined that it did not, and neither side challenged that holding on\nappeal. The same was true in the Fourth Circuit, but that court\nexamined the question sua sponte because it viewed the Anti-Injunction\nAct as a limit on its subject matter jurisdiction. See Liberty Univ., 671\n10         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                   Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.\n                     Opinion R the Court \n\n\n   The second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly\nchallenged here is the Medicaid expansion. Enacted in\n1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist\npregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the\nelderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10). In order to receive that funding,\nStates must comply with federal criteria governing mat-\nters such as who receives care and what services are pro-\nvided at what cost. By 1982 every State had chosen to\nparticipate in Medicaid. Federal funds received through\nthe Medicaid program have become a substantial part of\nstate budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most\nStates\u2019 total revenue.\n   The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medi-\ncaid program and increases the number of individuals the\nStates must cover. For example, the Act requires state\nprograms to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with\nincomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level,\nwhereas many States now cover adults with children only\nif their income is considerably lower, and do not cover\nchildless adults at all. See \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The\nAct increases federal funding to cover the States\u2019 costs in\nexpanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a\nportion of the costs on their own. \u00a71396d(y)(1). If a State\ndoes not comply with the Act\u2019s new coverage require-\nments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those\nrequirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. See\n\u00a71396c.\n   Along with their challenge to the individual mandate,\nthe state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the\nMedicaid expansion exceeds Congress\u2019s constitutional\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nF. 3d, at 400\u2013401.

S. ___ (2011). Because no party supports the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s holding that the individual mandate can\nbe completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable\nCare Act, we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that\naspect of the judgment below. And because there is a\nreasonable argument that the Anti-Injunction Act de-\nprives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ-\nual mandate, but no party supports that proposition, we\nappointed an amicus curiae to advance it.2\n                              II\n   Before turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have\nthe authority to do so. The Anti-Injunction Act provides\nthat \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment\nor collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court\nby any person, whether or not such person is the per-\nson against whom such tax was assessed.\u201d 26 U.

Williams Packing & Nav. Co., 370 U. S. 1,\n7\u20138 (1962).\n   The penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care\nAct\u2019s individual mandate first becomes enforceable in\n2014. The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to\nrestrain the penalty\u2019s future collection. Amicus contends\nthat the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a\ntax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this\nsuit.\n   The text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.\nThe Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits \u201cfor the purpose\nof restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d\n\u00a77421(a) (emphasis added). Congress, however, chose to\ndescribe the \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment\u201d imposed on\nthose who forgo health insurance not as a \u201ctax,\u201d but as a\n\u201cpenalty.\u201d \u00a7\u00a75000A(b), (g)(2). There is no immediate\nreason to think that a statute applying to \u201cany tax\u201d would\napply to a \u201cpenalty.\u201d\n   Congress\u2019s decision to label this exaction a \u201cpenalty\u201d\nrather than a \u201ctax\u201d is significant because the Affordable\nCare Act describes many other exactions it creates as\n\u201ctaxes.\u201d See Thomas More, 651 F. 3d, at 551. Where\nCongress uses certain language in one part of a statute\nand different language in another, it is generally pre-\nsumed that Congress acts intentionally. See Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983).\n   Amicus argues that even though Congress did not label\nthe shared responsibility payment a tax, we should treat it\nas such under the Anti-Injunction Act because it functions\nlike a tax. It is true that Congress cannot change whether\nan exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur-\nposes simply by describing it as one or the other. Congress\nmay not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing\nClause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019s constraint\non criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial pun-\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

S. 20, 36\u201337 (1922); Department of Revenue of Mont. v.\nKurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 779 (1994).\n   The Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act,\nhowever, are creatures of Congress\u2019s own creation. How\nthey relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best\nevidence of Congress\u2019s intent is the statutory text. We\nhave thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily\ndescribed \u201ctaxes\u201d even where that label was inaccurate.\nSee Bailey v. George, 259 U. S. 16 (1922) (Anti-Injunction\nAct applies to \u201cChild Labor Tax\u201d struck down as exceeding\nCongress\u2019s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).\n   Congress can, of course, describe something as a penalty\nbut direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for pur-\nposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. For example, 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a76671(a) provides that \u201cany reference in this title to \u2018tax\u2019\nimposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the\npenalties and liabilities provided by\u201d subchapter 68B of\nthe Internal Revenue Code. Penalties in subchapter 68B\nare thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes\nthe Anti-Injunction Act. The individual mandate, how-\never, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code. Nor does any\nother provision state that references to taxes in Title 26\nshall also be \u201cdeemed\u201d to apply to the individual mandate.\n   Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the\nAnti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate,\nalbeit by a more circuitous route. Section 5000A(g)(1) spec-\nifies that the penalty for not complying with the man-\ndate \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\nas an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter\n68.\u201d Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn,\n\u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner as\ntaxes.\u201d \u00a76671(a). According to amicus, by directing that\nthe penalty be \u201cassessed and collected in the same man-\nner as taxes,\u201d \u00a75000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act\napplicable to this penalty.\n14       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                 Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J.\n                   Opinion R the Court \n\n\n   The Government disagrees. It argues that \u00a75000A(g)(1)\ndoes not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act,\nbecause \u00a75000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of\nthe Treasury to use the same \u201c \u2018methodology and proce-\ndures\u2019 \u201d to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.\nBrief for United States 32\u201333 (quoting Seven-Sky, 661\nF. 3d, at 11).\n   We think the Government has the better reading. As\nit observes, \u201cAssessment\u201d and \u201cCollection\u201d are chapters of\nthe Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author-\nity to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying\nthe means by which he shall do so. See \u00a76201 (assess-\nment authority); \u00a76301 (collection authority). Section\n5000A(g)(1)\u2019s command that the penalty be \u201cassessed and\ncollected in the same manner\u201d as taxes is best read as\nreferring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the\nsame authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.\nThat interpretation is consistent with the remainder of\n\u00a75000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he\nmay use to collect the penalty. See \u00a75000A(g)(2)(A) (bar-\nring criminal prosecutions); \u00a75000A(g)(2)(B) (prohibiting\nthe Secretary from using notices of lien and levies). The\nAnti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the\nprocedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.\n   Amicus argues in the alternative that a different section\nof the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the\npenalty as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. Section\n6201(a) authorizes the Secretary to make \u201cassessments of\nall taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions\nto the tax, and assessable penalties).\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAmicus contends that the penalty must be a tax, because\nit is an assessable penalty and \u00a76201(a) says that taxes\ninclude assessable penalties.\n   That argument has force only if \u00a76201(a) is read in\nisolation. The Code contains many provisions treating\ntaxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms. See, e.g.,\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

There\nwould, for example, be no need for \u00a76671(a) to deem \u201ctax\u201d\nto refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code al-\nready included all such penalties in the term \u201ctax.\u201d In-\ndeed, amicus\u2019s earlier observation that the Code requires\nassessable penalties to be assessed and collected \u201cin the\nsame manner as taxes\u201d makes little sense if assessable\npenalties are themselves taxes. In light of the Code\u2019s\nconsistent distinction between the terms \u201ctax\u201d and \u201cas-\nsessable penalty,\u201d we must accept the Government\u2019s in-\nterpretation: \u00a76201(a) instructs the Secretary that his\nauthority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess\npenalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to\ntaxes for other purposes.\n  The Affordable Care Act does not require that the pen-\nalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be\ntreated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\nThe Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this\nsuit, and we may proceed to the merits.\n                              III\n   The Government advances two theories for the proposi-\ntion that Congress had constitutional authority to enact\nthe individual mandate. First, the Government argues\nthat Congress had the power to enact the mandate under\nthe Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may\norder individuals to buy health insurance because the\nfailure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could un-\ndercut the Affordable Care Act\u2019s other reforms. Second,\nthe Government argues that if the commerce power does\nnot support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it\nas an exercise of Congress\u2019s power to tax. According to the\nGovernment, even if Congress lacks the power to direct\nindividuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the indi-\nvidual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so,\nand thus the law may be upheld as a tax.\n16       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n                              A\n  The Government\u2019s first argument is that the individual\nmandate is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the\nCommerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.\nAccording to the Government, the health care market is\ncharacterized by a significant cost-shifting problem. Every-\none will eventually need health care at a time and to an\nextent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insur-\nance, they often will not be able to pay for it. Because\nstate and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to\nprovide a certain degree of care to individuals without\nregard to their ability to pay, see, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395dd;\nFla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7395.1041, hospitals end up receiving\ncompensation for only a portion of the services they pro-\nvide. To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to\ninsurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass\non the cost to policy holders in the form of higher pre-\nmiums. Congress estimated that the cost of uncompen-\nsated care raises family health insurance premiums, on\naverage, by over $1,000 per year. 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(F).\n  In the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the\nproblem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage\nbecause of preexisting conditions or other health issues. It\ndid so through the Act\u2019s \u201cguaranteed-issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity-\nrating\u201d provisions. These provisions together prohibit in-\nsurance companies from denying coverage to those with\nsuch conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher\npremiums than healthy individuals. See \u00a7\u00a7300gg, 300gg\u20131,\n300gg\u20133, 300gg\u20134.\n  The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do\nnot, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who\nchoose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health\ncare needs. In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that\nproblem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay\npurchasing health insurance until they become sick, rely-\ning on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             17\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nThe reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on\ninsurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals\nbut prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay\nfor their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly\nincrease premiums on everyone. See Brief for America\u2019s\nHealth Insurance Plans et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11\u2013\n393 etc. 8\u20139.\n  The individual mandate was Congress\u2019s solution to\nthese problems. By requiring that individuals purchase\nhealth insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by\nthose who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the\nmandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy\nindividuals, whose premiums on average will be higher\nthan their health care expenses. This allows insurers to\nsubsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals\nthe reforms require them to accept. The Government\nclaims that Congress has power under the Commerce and\nNecessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.\n                               1\n   The Government contends that the individual mandate\nis within Congress\u2019s power because the failure to pur-\nchase insurance \u201chas a substantial and deleterious effect\non interstate commerce\u201d by creating the cost-shifting prob-\nlem. Brief for United States 34. The path of our Com-\nmerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, see\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 552\u2013559 (1995), but\nit is now well established that Congress has broad author-\nity under the Clause. We have recognized, for example,\nthat \u201c[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is\nnot confined to the regulation of commerce among the\nstates,\u201d but extends to activities that \u201chave a substantial\neffect on interstate commerce.\u201d United States v. Darby,\n312 U. S. 100, 118\u2013119 (1941).

S., at 127\u2013128.\n   Given its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Con-\ngress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety\nof ways to address the pressing needs of the time. But\nCongress has never attempted to rely on that power to\ncompel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase\nan unwanted product.3 Legislative novelty is not nec-\nessarily fatal; there is a first time for everything. But\nsometimes \u201cthe most telling indication of [a] severe con-\nstitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent\u201d\nfor Congress\u2019s action. Free Enterprise Fund v.

Lopez, supra, at 564.\n   The Constitution grants Congress the power to \u201cregulate\nCommerce.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power\nto regulate commerce presupposes the existence of com-\nmercial activity to be regulated. If the power to \u201cregulate\u201d\nsomething included the power to create it, many of the\nprovisions in the Constitution would be superfluous. For\nexample, the Constitution gives Congress the power to\n\u201ccoin Money,\u201d in addition to the power to \u201cregulate the\nValue thereof.\u201d Id., cl. 5.

If the power to regulate the\narmed forces or the value of money included the power to\nbring the subject of the regulation into existence, the\nspecific grant of such powers would have been unneces-\nsary. The language of the Constitution reflects the natu-\nral understanding that the power to regulate assumes\nthere is already something to be regulated. See Gibbons, 9\nWheat., at 188 (\u201c[T]he enlightened patriots who framed\nour constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be\nunderstood to have employed words in their natural sense,\nand to have intended what they have said\u201d).4\n  Our precedent also reflects this understanding. As\nexpansive as our cases construing the scope of the com-\nmerce power have been, they all have one thing in com-\nmon: They uniformly describe the power as reaching\n\u201cactivity.\u201d It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when\nquoting them.

But to reach\nthis conclusion, the case cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG relied on a diction-\nary in which \u201c[t]o order; to command\u201d was the fifth-alternative defini-\ntion of \u201cto direct,\u201d which was itself the second-alternative definition of\n\u201cto regulate.\u201d See Seven-Sky, supra, at 16 (citing S.

Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by\npointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring\ncountless decisions an individual could potentially make\nwithin the scope of federal regulation, and\u2014under the\nGovernment\u2019s theory\u2014empower Congress to make those\ndecisions for him.\n   Applying the Government\u2019s logic to the familiar case of\nWickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry\nus from the notion of a government of limited powers. In\nWickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im-\nposed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption\non his own farm. 317 U. S., at 114\u2013115, 128\u2013129. That\namount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota\nunder a program designed to support the price of wheat by\nlimiting supply. The Court rejected the farmer\u2019s argument\nthat growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the\nreach of the commerce power. It did so on the ground that\nthe farmer\u2019s decision to grow wheat for his own use al-\nlowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market. That\ndecision, when considered in the aggregate along with sim-\nilar decisions of others, would have had a substantial ef-\nfect on the interstate market for wheat. Id., at 127\u2013129.\n   Wickard has long been regarded as \u201cperhaps the most\nfar reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over\nintrastate activity,\u201d Lopez, 514 U. S., at 560, but the Gov-\nernment\u2019s theory in this case would go much further.\nUnder Wickard it is within Congress\u2019s power to regulate\nthe market for wheat by supporting its price. But price\ncan be supported by increasing demand as well as by\ndecreasing supply. The aggregated decisions of some\nconsumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect\non the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase\nhealth insurance have on the price of insurance. Congress\ncan therefore command that those not buying wheat do so,\njust as it argues here that it may command that those not\n22       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nbuying health insurance do so. The farmer in Wickard\nwas at least actively engaged in the production of wheat,\nand the Government could regulate that activity because\nof its effect on commerce. The Government\u2019s theory here\nwould effectively override that limitation, by establishing\nthat individuals may be regulated under the Commerce\nClause whenever enough of them are not doing something\nthe Government would have them do.\n   Indeed, the Government\u2019s logic would justify a manda-\ntory purchase to solve almost any problem. See Seven-Sky,\n661 F. 3d, at 14\u201315 (noting the Government\u2019s inability\nto \u201cidentify any mandate to purchase a product or ser-\nvice in interstate commerce that would be unconstitu-\ntional\u201d under its theory of the commerce power). To\nconsider a different example in the health care market, many\nAmericans do not eat a balanced diet. That group makes\nup a larger percentage of the total population than those\nwithout health insurance. See, e.g., Dept. of Agriculture\nand Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dietary Guide-\nlines for Americans 1 (2010). The failure of that group\nto have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a\ngreater extent than the failure of the uninsured to pur-\nchase insurance. See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, &\nDietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity:\nPayer- and Service-Specific Estimates, 28 Health Affairs\nw822 (2009) (detailing the \u201cundeniable link between ris-\ning rates of obesity and rising medical spending,\u201d and esti-\nmating that \u201cthe annual medical burden of obesity has\nrisen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and\ncould amount to $147 billion per year in 2008\u201d). Those in-\ncreased costs are borne in part by other Americans who\nmust pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the\ninsured. See Center for Applied Ethics, Voluntary Health\nRisks: Who Should Pay?, 6 Issues in Ethics 6 (1993) (not-\ning \u201coverwhelming evidence that individuals with un-\nhealthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Congress addressed the insurance problem by\nordering everyone to buy insurance. Under the Gov-\nernment\u2019s theory, Congress could address the diet problem\nby ordering everyone to buy vegetables. See Dietary\nGuidelines, supra, at 19 (\u201cImproved nutrition, appropriate\neating behaviors, and increased physical activity have tre-\nmendous potential to . . . reduce health care costs\u201d).\n   People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things\nthat would be good for them or good for society. Those\nfailures\u2014joined with the similar failures of others\u2014can\nreadily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\nUnder the Government\u2019s logic, that authorizes Congress to\nuse its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the\nGovernment would have them act.\n   That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution\nenvisioned. James Madison explained that the Commerce\nClause was \u201can addition which few oppose and from which\nno apprehensions are entertained.\u201d The Federalist No. 45,\nat 293.

Industrial Union Dept., AFL\u2013CIO\nv. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U. S. 607, 673 (1980)\n(Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). As we have ex-\nplained, \u201cthe framers of the Constitution were not mere\nvisionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but\npractical men, dealing with the facts of political life as\nthey understood them, putting into form the government\nthey were creating, and prescribing in language clear\nand intelligible the powers that government was to take.\u201d\nSouth Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 449 (1905).\nThe Framers gave Congress the power to regulate com-\nmerce, not to compel it, and for over 200 years both our\ndecisions and Congress\u2019s actions have reflected this un-\nderstanding. There is no reason to depart from that un-\nderstanding now.\n   The Government sees things differently. It argues that\nbecause sickness and injury are unpredictable but una-\nvoidable, \u201cthe uninsured as a class are active in the mar-\nket for health care, which they regularly seek and obtain.\u201d\nBrief for United States 50.

But \u201cself-insurance\u201d is, in this context, nothing more than a de-\nscription of the failure to purchase insurance.

The phrase \u201cactive in the market\u201d\ncannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by\nthe individual mandate are not currently engaged in any\ncommercial activity involving health care, and that fact is\nfatal to the Government\u2019s effort to \u201cregulate the uninsured\nas a class.\u201d Id., at 42. Our precedents recognize Con-\ngress\u2019s power to regulate \u201cclass[es] of activities,\u201d Gonzales\nv. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 17 (2005) (emphasis added), not\nclasses of individuals, apart from any activity in which\nthey are engaged, see, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 153 (\u201cPeti-\ntioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in\n\u2018extortionate credit transactions\u2019 . . .\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n   The individual mandate\u2019s regulation of the uninsured as\na class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to\nexisting commercial activity. The mandate primarily\naffects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to\nneed significant health care and have other priorities for\nspending their money. It is precisely because these indi-\nviduals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health\ncare costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of\nforcing insurance companies to cover others who impose\ngreater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect.\nSee 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(I) (recognizing that the mandate\nwould \u201cbroaden the health insurance risk pool to include\nhealthy individuals, which will lower health insurance\npremiums\u201d). If the individual mandate is targeted at a\nclass, it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than\nactivity is its defining feature.\n26       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The Government, however, claims that this does not\nmatter. The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger\nCongress\u2019s authority that almost all those who are unin-\nsured will, at some unknown point in the future, engage\nin a health care transaction. Asserting that \u201c[t]here is no\ntemporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,\u201d the Gov-\nernment argues that because \u201c[e]veryone subject to this\nregulation is in or will be in the health care market,\u201d they\ncan be \u201cregulated in advance.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 109 (Mar.\n27, 2012).\n   The proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct\nof an individual today because of prophesied future ac-\ntivity finds no support in our precedent. We have said that\nCongress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco-\nnomic activity. See, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB,\n305 U. S. 197 (1938) (regulating the labor practices of\nutility companies); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United\nStates, 379 U. S. 241 (1964) (prohibiting discrimination by\nhotel operators); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294\n(1964) (prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners).\nBut we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that\nactivity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently\nengaged in commerce. Each one of our cases, including\nthose cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 20\u201321, involved\npreexisting economic activity. See, e.g., Wickard, 317\nU. S., at 127\u2013129 (producing wheat); Raich, supra, at 25\n(growing marijuana).\n   Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food,\nclothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not\nauthorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular\nproducts in those or other markets today. The Commerce\nClause is not a general license to regulate an individual\nfrom cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably\nengage in particular transactions. Any police power to\nregulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities,\nremains vested in the States.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           27\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The Government argues that the individual mandate\ncan be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because\nhealth insurance is a unique product. According to the\nGovernment, upholding the individual mandate would\nnot justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or\nbroccoli because, as the Government puts it, \u201c[h]ealth in-\nsurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or\nbroccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consump-\ntion and covering universal risks.\u201d Reply Brief for United\nStates 19. But cars and broccoli are no more purchased\nfor their \u201cown sake\u201d than health insurance. They are\npurchased to cover the need for transportation and food.\n   The Government says that health insurance and health\ncare financing are \u201cinherently integrated.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 41. But that does not mean the compelled purchase\nof the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the\nsecond. No matter how \u201cinherently integrated\u201d health\ninsurance and health care consumption may be, they are\nnot the same thing: They involve different transactions,\nentered into at different times, with different providers.\nAnd for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant\nhealth care needs will be years, or even decades, away.\nThe proximity and degree of connection between the\nmandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lack-\ning to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Gov-\nernment.      The individual mandate forces individuals\ninto commerce precisely because they elected to refrain\nfrom commercial activity. Such a law cannot be sus-\ntained under a clause authorizing Congress to \u201cregulate\nCommerce.\u201d\n                           2\n  The Government next contends that Congress has the\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the\nindividual mandate because the mandate is an \u201cintegral\npart of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation\u201d\u2014\n28       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v.

Under this argu-\nment, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an\nindividual\u2019s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it\nis enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a\nway that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.\n   The power to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary\nand proper for carrying into Execution\u201d the powers enu-\nmerated in the Constitution, Art.

Each\nof our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause in-\nvolved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service\nto, a granted power. For example, we have upheld provi-\nsions permitting continued confinement of those already\nin federal custody when they could not be safely released,\nComstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1\u20132); criminaliz-\ning bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds,\nSabri v.

Rather, such a conception of the Necessary and\nProper Clause would work a substantial expansion of\nfederal authority. No longer would Congress be limited to\nregulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some\npreexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of\nfederal regulation. Instead, Congress could reach beyond\n30       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Even if the individual mandate is \u201cnecessary\u201d to the\nAct\u2019s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal\npower is not a \u201cproper\u201d means for making those reforms\neffective.\n   The Government relies primarily on our decision in\nGonzales v. Raich. In Raich, we considered \u201ccomprehen-\nsive legislation to regulate the interstate market\u201d in mari-\njuana. 545 U. S., at 22. Certain individuals sought an\nexemption from that regulation on the ground that they\nengaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.\nWe denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana\nis a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could\nbe readily diverted into the interstate market. Congress\u2019s\nattempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana\nwould therefore have been substantially undercut if it\ncould not also regulate intrastate possession and con-\nsumption. Id., at 19. Accordingly, we recognized that\n\u201cCongress was acting well within its authority\u201d under the\nNecessary and Proper Clause even though its \u201cregulation\nensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.\u201d Id., at 22; see\nalso Perez, 402 U.

Raich thus did not involve\nthe exercise of any \u201cgreat substantive and independent\npower,\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.\nInstead, it concerned only the constitutionality of \u201cindi-\nvidual applications of a concededly valid statutory\nscheme.\u201d Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).\n   Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as\na law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to\npurchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as\na \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d component of the insurance re-\nforms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the\nmandate. Accord, post, at 4\u201316 (joint opinion of SCALIA,\nKENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Because the Com-\nmerce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it\nis necessary to turn to the Government\u2019s second argument:\nthat the mandate may be upheld as within Congress\u2019s\nenumerated power to \u201clay and collect Taxes.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl. 1.\n   The Government\u2019s tax power argument asks us to view\nthe statute differently than we did in considering its com-\nmerce power theory. In making its Commerce Clause\nargument, the Government defended the mandate as a\nregulation requiring individuals to purchase health in-\nsurance. The Government does not claim that the taxing\npower allows Congress to issue such a command. Instead,\nthe Government asks us to read the mandate not as order-\ning individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a\ntax on those who do not buy that product.\n   The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one\npossible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that\nreads \u201cno vehicles in the park\u201d might, or might not, ban\nbicycles in the park. And it is well established that if\na statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates\nthe Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that\ndoes not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: \u201cNo\ncourt ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it una-\nvoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve\na violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.\u201d\nParsons v. Bedford, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/rtj/parsons-v-bedford/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448\u2013449 (1830). Justice\nHolmes made the same point a century later: \u201c[T]he rule is\nsettled that as between two possible interpretations of a\nstatute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and\nby the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which\nwill save the Act.\u201d Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148\n(1927) (concurring opinion).\n   The most straightforward reading of the mandate is\nthat it commands individuals to purchase insurance.\n32       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nAfter all, it states that individuals \u201cshall\u201d maintain health\ninsurance. 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(a). Congress thought it\ncould enact such a command under the Commerce Clause,\nand the Government primarily defended the law on that\nbasis. But, for the reasons explained above, the Com-\nmerce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under\nour precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the\nGovernment\u2019s alternative reading of the statute\u2014that it\nonly imposes a tax on those without insurance\u2014is a rea-\nsonable one.\n   Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain\nhealth insurance, the only consequence is that he must\nmake an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his\ntaxes. See \u00a75000A(b). That, according to the Government,\nmeans the mandate can be regarded as establishing a\ncondition\u2014not owning health insurance\u2014that triggers a\ntax\u2014the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory,\nthe mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.\nRather, it makes going without insurance just another\nthing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earn-\ning income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike\non certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it\nmay be within Congress\u2019s constitutional power to tax.\n   The question is not whether that is the most natural\ninterpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a\n\u201cfairly possible\u201d one. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62\n(1932). As we have explained, \u201cevery reasonable construc-\ntion must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from\nunconstitutionality.\u201d Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648,\n657 (1895). The Government asks us to interpret the\nmandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate\nthe Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of\ndeference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for\nthe reasons set forth below.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

The \u201c[s]hared responsibility payment,\u201d as the\nstatute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by \u201ctax-\npayer[s]\u201d when they file their tax returns. 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a75000A(b). It does not apply to individuals who do not\npay federal income taxes because their household income\nis less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue\nCode. \u00a75000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the pay-\nment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as\ntaxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing\nstatus. \u00a7\u00a75000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to\npay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by\nthe IRS, which\u2014as we previously explained\u2014must assess\nand collect it \u201cin the same manner as taxes.\u201d Supra, at\n13\u201314. This process yields the essential feature of any tax:\nit produces at least some revenue for the Government.\nUnited States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22, 28, n. 4 (1953).\nIndeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion\nper year by 2017.

It is up to Con-\ngress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any\nparticular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Con-\ngress\u2019s choice of label on that question. That choice does\nnot, however, control whether an exaction is within Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional power to tax.\n   Our precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two\n34       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

In\nthe first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so-\ncalled tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act. George,\n259 U. S., at 20. Congress knew that suits to obstruct\ntaxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction\nAct; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress\ntherefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. In\nthe second case, however, we held that the same exaction,\nalthough labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Con-\ngress\u2019s taxing power. Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S., at 38.\nThat constitutional question was not controlled by Con-\ngress\u2019s choice of label.\n   We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes\nnonetheless were authorized by Congress\u2019s power to tax.\nIn the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal\nlicenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets\u2014for which the\nlicensee had to pay a fee\u2014could be sustained as exercises\nof the taxing power. 5 Wall., at 471.

For ex-\nample, in Drexel Furniture, we focused on three practical\ncharacteristics of the so-called tax on employing child\nlaborers that convinced us the \u201ctax\u201d was actually a pen-\nalty. First, the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy bur-\nden\u201410 percent of a company\u2019s net income\u2014on those who\nemployed children, no matter how small their infraction.\nSecond, it imposed that exaction only on those who know-\ningly employed underage laborers. Such scienter require-\nments are typical of punitive statutes, because Congress\noften wishes to punish only those who intentionally break\nthe law. Third, this \u201ctax\u201d was enforced in part by the\nDepartment of Labor, an agency responsible for pun-\nishing violations of labor laws, not collecting revenue. 259\nU.

The reasons the Court in Drexel Furni-\nture held that what was called a \u201ctax\u201d there was a penalty\nsupport the conclusion that what is called a \u201cpenalty\u201d here\nmay be viewed as a tax.9\n   None of this is to say that the payment is not intended\nto affect individual conduct. Although the payment will\nraise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to ex-\npand health insurance coverage. But taxes that seek to\ninfluence conduct are nothing new. Some of our earliest\nfederal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported\nmanufactured goods in order to foster the growth of do-\nmestic industry. See W. Brownlee, Federal Taxation in\nAmerica 22 (2d ed. 2004); cf. 2 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States \u00a7962, p. 434 (1833)\n(\u201cthe taxing power is often, very often, applied for other\npurposes, than revenue\u201d).

That \u00a75000A seeks to shape\ndecisions about whether to buy health insurance does not\nmean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing\npower.\n   In distinguishing penalties from taxes, this Court has\nexplained that \u201cif the concept of penalty means anything,\nit means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.\u201d\nUnited States v.

S. 568, 572 (1931) (\u201c[A] penalty, as the\nword is here used, is an exaction imposed by statute as\npunishment for an unlawful act\u201d). While the individual\nmandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health\ninsurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do\nso is unlawful. Neither the Act nor any other law attaches\nnegative legal consequences to not buying health insur-\nance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. The Gov-\nernment agrees with that reading, confirming that if\nsomeone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insur-\nance, they have fully complied with the law.

It suggests instead that the\nshared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citi-\nzens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health\ninsurance.\n   The plaintiffs contend that Congress\u2019s choice of lan-\nguage\u2014stating that individuals \u201cshall\u201d obtain insurance\nor pay a \u201cpenalty\u201d\u2014requires reading \u00a75000A as punishing\nunlawful conduct, even if that interpretation would ren-\nder the law unconstitutional. We have rejected a similar\nargument before. In New York v.

S., at 169 (quoting 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72021c(a)(1)(A)). A State that shipped its waste to another\nState was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State,\na portion of which would be paid over to the Federal\nGovernment.       And a State that did not adhere to the\nstatutory scheme faced \u201c[p]enalties for failure to comply,\u201d\nincluding increases in the surcharge. \u00a72021e(e)(2); New\nYork, 505 U. S., at 152\u2013153. New York urged us to read\nthe statute as a federal command that the state legisla-\nture enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would\nhave violated the Constitution. To avoid that outcome, we\ninterpreted the statute to impose only \u201ca series of incen-\ntives\u201d for the State to take responsibility for its waste. We\nthen sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government\nas an exercise of the taxing power. Id., at 169\u2013174.

J.\n                        Opinion R the Court\n\n   The joint dissenters argue that we cannot uphold\n\u00a75000A as a tax because Congress did not \u201cframe\u201d it as\nsuch. Post, at 17. In effect, they contend that even if\nthe Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we\ninterpret this statute to do, the law must be struck down\nbecause Congress used the wrong labels. An example may\nhelp illustrate why labels should not control here. Sup-\npose Congress enacted a statute providing that every\ntaxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient win-\ndows must pay $50 to the IRS. The amount due is adjusted\nbased on factors such as taxable income and joint filing\nstatus, and is paid along with the taxpayer\u2019s income tax\nreturn. Those whose income is below the filing threshold\nneed not pay. The required payment is not called a \u201ctax,\u201d\na \u201cpenalty,\u201d or anything else. No one would doubt that\nthis law imposed a tax, and was within Congress\u2019s power\nto tax. That conclusion should not change simply because\nCongress used the word \u201cpenalty\u201d to describe the pay-\nment. Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly\n\u201c[i]mpos[e] a tax through judicial legislation.\u201d Post, at 25.\nRather, it would give practical effect to the Legislature\u2019s\nenactment.\n   Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the\npower to impose the exaction in \u00a75000A under the taxing\npower, and that \u00a75000A need not be read to do more than\nimpose a tax. That is sufficient to sustain it.

J.\n                   Opinion R the Court \n\n\n138, 144 (1948).\n   Even if the taxing power enables Congress to impose\na tax on not obtaining health insurance, any tax must\nstill comply with other requirements in the Constitution.\nPlaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment\ndoes not do so, citing Article I, \u00a79, clause 4. That clause\nprovides: \u201cNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,\nunless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein\nbefore directed to be taken.\u201d This requirement means that\nany \u201cdirect Tax\u201d must be apportioned so that each State\npays in proportion to its population. According to the\nplaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a\ndirect tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress\nmade no effort to apportion it among the States.\n   Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was\nunclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as\na \u201chead tax\u201d or a \u201cpoll tax\u201d), might be a direct tax. See\nSpringer v. United States, 102 U. S. 586, 596\u2013598 (1881).\nSoon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on owner-\nship of carriages, over James Madison\u2019s objection that it\nwas an unapportioned direct tax. Id., at 597. This Court\nupheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such\na tax would make little sense, because it would have re-\nquired taxing carriage owners at dramatically different\nrates depending on how many carriages were in their\nhome State. See Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 174\n(1796) (opinion of Chase, J.). The Court was unanimous,\nand those Justices who wrote opinions either directly\nasserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of\ntaxation were direct: capitations and land taxes. See id.,\nat 175; id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 183\n(opinion of Iredell, J.).\n   That narrow view of what a direct tax might be per-\nsisted for a century. In 1880, for example, we explained that\n\u201cdirect taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are\nonly capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument,\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

In\n1895, we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on\npersonal property and income from personal property, in\nthe course of striking down aspects of the federal income\ntax. Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust Co., 158 U. S. 601,\n618 (1895). That result was overturned by the Sixteenth\nAmendment, although we continued to consider taxes on\npersonal property to be direct taxes. See Eisner v. Macom-\nber, 252 U. S. 189, 218\u2013219 (1920).\n  A tax on going without health insurance does not fall\nwithin any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a\ncapitation. Capitations are taxes paid by every person,\n\u201cwithout regard to property, profession, or any other cir-\ncumstance.\u201d Hylton, supra, at 175 (opinion of Chase, J.)\n(emphasis altered). The whole point of the shared respon-\nsibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir-\ncumstances\u2014earning a certain amount of income but not\nobtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly\nnot a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.\nThe shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax\nthat must be apportioned among the several States.\n  There may, however, be a more fundamental objection\nto a tax on those who lack health insurance. Even if only\na tax, the payment under \u00a75000A(b) remains a burden\nthat the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not\nan act. If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause\nas authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain\nfrom commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to\npermit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.\n  Three considerations allay this concern. First, and most\nimportantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does\nnot guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through\ninactivity. A capitation, after all, is a tax that every-\none must pay simply for existing, and capitations are\nexpressly contemplated by the Constitution. The Court\ntoday holds that our Constitution protects us from federal\n42       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

But from its creation,\nthe Constitution has made no such promise with respect to\ntaxes. See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy\n(Nov. 13, 1789) (\u201cOur new Constitution is now established\n. . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain,\nexcept death and taxes\u201d).\n    Whether the mandate can be upheld under the Com-\nmerce Clause is a question about the scope of federal\nauthority. Its answer depends on whether Congress can\nexercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of\ndirecting individuals to purchase insurance. Congress\u2019s\nuse of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something\nis, by contrast, not new. Tax incentives already promote,\nfor example, purchasing homes and professional educa-\ntions. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7163(h), 25A. Sustaining the\nmandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has\nproperly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchas-\ning health insurance, not whether it can. Upholding the\nindividual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does\nnot recognize any new federal power. It determines that\nCongress has used an existing one.\n    Second, Congress\u2019s ability to use its taxing power to\ninfluence conduct is not without limits. A few of our cases\npoliced these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive\nexactions obviously designed to regulate behavior other-\nwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1 (1936); Drexel\nFurniture, 259 U. S. 20. More often and more recently\nwe have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive\nor effect of revenue-raising measures. See Kahriger, 345\nU. S., at 27\u201331 (collecting cases). We have nonetheless\nmaintained that \u201c \u2018there comes a time in the extension of\nthe penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses\nits character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the\ncharacteristics of regulation and punishment.\u2019 \u201d Kurth\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

S., at 779 (quoting Drexel Furniture, supra,\nat 38).\n   We have already explained that the shared responsibil-\nity payment\u2019s practical characteristics pass muster as a\ntax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing\npower. Supra, at 35\u201336. Because the tax at hand is\nwithin even those strict limits, we need not here decide the\nprecise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive\nthat the taxing power does not authorize it. It remains\ntrue, however, that the \u201c \u2018power to tax is not the power to\ndestroy while this Court sits.\u2019 \u201d Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n v.\nTexas Co., 336 U. S. 342, 364 (1949) (quoting Panhandle\nOil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223\n(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting)).\n   Third, although the breadth of Congress\u2019s power to tax\nis greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing\npower does not give Congress the same degree of control\nover individual behavior. Once we recognize that Con-\ngress may regulate a particular decision under the Com-\nmerce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full\nweight to bear. Congress may simply command individ-\nuals to do as it directs. An individual who disobeys may\nbe subjected to criminal sanctions. Those sanctions can\ninclude not only fines and imprisonment, but all the at-\ntendant consequences of being branded a criminal: depri-\nvation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right\nto bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment op-\nportunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other\ncontroversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.\n   By contrast, Congress\u2019s authority under the taxing\npower is limited to requiring an individual to pay money\ninto the Federal Treasury, no more. If a tax is properly\npaid, the Government has no power to compel or punish\nindividuals subject to it. We do not make light of the se-\nvere burden that taxation\u2014especially taxation motivated\nby a regulatory purpose\u2014can impose. But imposition\n44         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful\nchoice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing\nto pay a tax levied on that choice.11\n  The Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that certain in-\ndividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health\ninsurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Be-\ncause the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role\nto forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.\n                               D\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG questions the necessity of rejecting\nthe Government\u2019s commerce power argument, given that\n\u00a75000A can be upheld under the taxing power. Post, at 37.\nBut the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy\ninsurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a com-\nmand if the Constitution allowed it. It is only because the\nCommerce Clause does not authorize such a command\nthat it is necessary to reach the taxing power question.\nAnd it is only because we have a duty to construe a stat-\nute to save it, if fairly possible, that \u00a75000A can be inter-\npreted as a tax. Without deciding the Commerce Clause\nquestion, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving\nconstruction.\n  The Federal Government does not have the power to\norder people to buy health insurance. Section 5000A\nwould therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command.\nThe Federal Government does have the power to impose a\ntax on those without health insurance. Section 5000A is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Of course, individuals do not have a lawful choice not to pay a tax\n\ndue, and may sometimes face prosecution for failing to do so (although\nnot for declining to make the shared responsibility payment, see 26\nU. S. C. \u00a75000A(g)(2)). But that does not show that the tax restricts the\nlawful choice whether to undertake or forgo the activity on which the tax\nis predicated. Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully\nforgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance\nand pay lower taxes.

This, they argue, violates the basic principle\nthat the \u201cFederal Government may not compel the States\nto enact or administer a federal regulatory program.\u201d New\nYork, 505 U. S., at 188.\n  There is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases\nstate obligations under Medicaid. The current Medicaid\nprogram requires States to cover only certain discrete\ncategories of needy individuals\u2014pregnant women, chil-\ndren, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the dis-\nabled. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10). There is no mandatory\ncoverage for most childless adults, and the States typically\ndo not offer any such coverage. The States also enjoy\nconsiderable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels\nfor parents of needy families. \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)(ii). On\naverage States cover only those unemployed parents who\nmake less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and\nonly those employed parents who make less than 63 per-\ncent of the poverty line.

In the\nfollowing years, the federal payment level gradually de-\ncreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. Ibid. In light of\nthe expansion in coverage mandated by the Act, the Federal\nGovernment estimates that its Medicaid spending will in-\ncrease by approximately $100 billion per year, nearly 40\npercent above current levels. Statement of Douglas W.\nElmendorf, CBO\u2019s Analysis of the Major Health Care\nLegislation Enacted in March 2010, p. 14, Table 2 (Mar.\n30, 2011).\n   The Spending Clause grants Congress the power \u201cto pay\nthe Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the\nUnited States.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1. We have\nlong recognized that Congress may use this power to grant\nfederal funds to the States, and may condition such a\ngrant upon the States\u2019 \u201ctaking certain actions that Con-\ngress could not require them to take.\u201d College Savings Bank,\n527 U.

Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring\nthat Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the\nstatus of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed-\neral system. That system \u201crests on what might at first\nseem a counterintuitive insight, that \u2018freedom is enhanced\nby the creation of two governments, not one.\u2019 \u201d Bond, 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Alden v. Maine, 527\nU. S. 706, 758 (1999)). For this reason, \u201cthe Constitution\nhas never been understood to confer upon Congress the\nability to require the States to govern according to Con-\ngress\u2019 instructions.\u201d New York, supra, at 162. Otherwise\nthe two-government system established by the Framers\nwould give way to a system that vests power in one central\ngovernment, and individual liberty would suffer.\n   That insight has led this Court to strike down fed-\neral legislation that commandeers a State\u2019s legislative or\nadministrative apparatus for federal purposes. See, e.g.,\nPrintz, 521 U. S., at 933 (striking down federal legisla-\ntion compelling state law enforcement officers to perform\nfederally mandated background checks on handgun pur-\nchasers); New York, supra, at 174\u2013175 (invalidating provi-\nsions of an Act that would compel a State to either take\ntitle to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste\nregulations). It has also led us to scrutinize Spending\nClause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using\nfinancial inducements to exert a \u201cpower akin to undue\ninfluence.\u201d Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548,\n590 (1937). Congress may use its spending power to cre-\nate incentives for States to act in accordance with federal\npolicies. But when \u201cpressure turns into compulsion,\u201d ibid.,\nthe legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\n\u201c[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the\nauthority to require the States to regulate.\u201d New York,\n48       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n505 U. S., at 178. That is true whether Congress directly\ncommands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State\nto adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.\n   Permitting the Federal Government to force the States\nto implement a federal program would threaten the politi-\ncal accountability key to our federal system. \u201c[W]here the\nFederal Government directs the States to regulate, it may\nbe state officials who will bear the brunt of public disap-\nproval, while the federal officials who devised the regu-\nlatory program may remain insulated from the electoral\nramifications of their decision.\u201d Id., at 169. Spending\nClause programs do not pose this danger when a State has\na legitimate choice whether to accept the federal condi-\ntions in exchange for federal funds. In such a situation,\nstate officials can fairly be held politically accountable for\nchoosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when\nthe State has no choice, the Federal Government can\nachieve its objectives without accountability, just as in\nNew York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened\nwhen Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because\nCongress can use that power to implement federal policy it\ncould not impose directly under its enumerated powers.\n   We addressed such concerns in Steward Machine. That\ncase involved a federal tax on employers that was abated\nif the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that\nmet certain federally specified conditions. An employer\nsued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly \u201cdriv[ing]\nthe state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure\ninto the enactment of unemployment compensation laws\nat the bidding of the central government.\u201d 301 U. S., at\n587. We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Gov-\nernment might employ its taxing power to exert a \u201cpower\nakin to undue influence\u201d upon the States. Id., at 590. But\nwe observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and\nabatement program to channel money to the States that\nwould otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Con-\ngress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the\nmoney into state programs only on the condition that the\nmoney be used for the same purposes. Predicating tax\nabatement on a State\u2019s adoption of a particular type of un-\nemployment legislation was therefore a means to \u201csafe-\nguard [the Federal Government\u2019s] own treasury.\u201d Id., at\n591. We held that \u201c[i]n such circumstances, if in no oth-\ners, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the\nbounds of power.\u201d Ibid.\n   In rejecting the argument that the federal law was a\n\u201cweapon[ ] of coercion, destroying or impairing the auton-\nomy of the states,\u201d the Court noted that there was no\nreason to suppose that the State in that case acted other\nthan through \u201cher unfettered will.\u201d Id., at 586, 590.\nIndeed, the State itself did \u201cnot offer a suggestion that in\npassing the unemployment law she was affected by du-\nress.\u201d Id., at 589.\n   As our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress\nmay attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and\nspending programs to preserve its control over the use of\nfederal funds. In the typical case we look to the States to\ndefend their prerogatives by adopting \u201cthe simple expedi-\nent of not yielding\u201d to federal blandishments when they\ndo not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.\nMassachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 482 (1923). The\nStates are separate and independent sovereigns. Some-\ntimes they have to act like it.\n   The States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion\nis far from the typical case. They object that Congress has\n\u201ccrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from\ncoercion,\u201d New York, supra, at 175, in the way it has struc-\ntured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the\nnew funds to States that will not accept the new condi-\ntions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those\nStates\u2019 existing Medicaid funds. The States claim that\n50       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                 Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthis threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling\nStates to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care\ncoverage effected by the Act.\n   Given the nature of the threat and the programs at\nissue here, we must agree. We have upheld Congress\u2019s\nauthority to condition the receipt of funds on the States\u2019\ncomplying with restrictions on the use of those funds,\nbecause that is the means by which Congress ensures that\nthe funds are spent according to its view of the \u201cgeneral\nWelfare.\u201d Conditions that do not here govern the use\nof the funds, however, cannot be justified on that ba-\nsis. When, for example, such conditions take the form of\nthreats to terminate other significant independent grants,\nthe conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressur-\ning the States to accept policy changes.\n   In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered a challenge to a\nfederal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a\nState\u2019s federal highway funds if the State did not raise its\ndrinking age to 21. The Court found that the condition\nwas \u201cdirectly related to one of the main purposes for which\nhighway funds are expended\u2014safe interstate travel.\u201d 483\nU. S., at 208. At the same time, the condition was not a\nrestriction on how the highway funds\u2014set aside for spec-\nific highway improvement and maintenance efforts\u2014were\nto be used.\n   We accordingly asked whether \u201cthe financial induce-\nment offered by Congress\u201d was \u201cso coercive as to pass the\npoint at which \u2018pressure turns into compulsion.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n211 (quoting Steward Machine, supra, at 590). By \u201cfinan-\ncial inducement\u201d the Court meant the threat of losing five\npercent of highway funds; no new money was offered to\nthe States to raise their drinking ages. We found that the\ninducement was not impermissibly coercive, because\nCongress was offering only \u201crelatively mild encouragement\nto the States.\u201d Dole, 483 U. S., at 211. We observed that\n\u201call South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          51\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncourse as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%\u201d of\nher highway funds. Ibid. In fact, the federal funds at\nstake constituted less than half of one percent of South\nDakota\u2019s budget at the time. See Nat. Assn. of State\nBudget Officers, The State Expenditure Report 59 (1987);\nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 791 F. 2d 628, 630 (CA8 1986). In\nconsequence, \u201cwe conclude[d] that [the] encouragement\nto state action [was] a valid use of the spending power.\u201d\nDole, 483 U. S., at 212. Whether to accept the drinking\nage change \u201cremain[ed] the prerogative of the States not\nmerely in theory but in fact.\u201d Id., at 211\u2013212.\n   In this case, the financial \u201cinducement\u201d Congress has\nchosen is much more than \u201crelatively mild encourage-\nment\u201d\u2014it is a gun to the head. Section 1396c of the Medi-\ncaid Act provides that if a State\u2019s Medicaid plan does\nnot comply with the Act\u2019s requirements, the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services may declare that \u201cfurther\npayments will not be made to the State.\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71396c. A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s\nexpansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not\nmerely \u201ca relatively small percentage\u201d of its existing Medi-\ncaid funding, but all of it. Dole, supra, at 211. Medicaid\nspending accounts for over 20 percent of the average\nState\u2019s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83\npercent of those costs. See Nat. Assn. of State Budget\nOfficers, Fiscal Year 2010 State Expenditure Report, p. 11,\nTable 5 (2011); 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(b). The Federal Gov-\nernment estimates that it will pay out approximately $3.3\ntrillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs\nof pre-expansion Medicaid. Brief for United States 10,\nn. 6. In addition, the States have developed intricate\nstatutory and administrative regimes over the course of\nmany decades to implement their objectives under existing\nMedicaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could con-\nclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one\npercent of South Dakota\u2019s budget left that State with a\n52         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v.

The\nthreatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\u2019s overall\nbudget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the\nStates with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid\nexpansion.12\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that Dole is distinguishable\nbecause here \u201cCongress has not threatened to withhold\nfunds earmarked for any other program.\u201d Post, at 47. But\nthat begs the question: The States contend that the ex-\npansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is\nforcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the\nexisting Medicaid program. We cannot agree that existing\nMedicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable\nCare Act are all one program simply because \u201cCongress\nstyled\u201d them as such. Post, at 49. If the expansion is not\nproperly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid\nprogram, Congress\u2019s decision to so title it is irrelevant.13\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 JUSTICE  GINSBURG observes that state Medicaid spending will in-\ncrease by only 0.8 percent after the expansion. Post, at 43. That not\nonly ignores increased state administrative expenses, but also assumes\nthat the Federal Government will continue to fund the expansion at the\ncurrent statutorily specified levels. It is not unheard of, however, for\nthe Federal Government to increase requirements in such a manner as\nto impose unfunded mandates on the States. More importantly, the\nsize of the new financial burden imposed on a State is irrelevant in\nanalyzing whether the State has been coerced into accepting that\nburden. \u201cYour money or your life\u201d is a coercive proposition, whether\nyou have a single dollar in your pocket or $500.\n  13 Nor, of course, can the number of pages the amendment occu-\n\npies, or the extent to which the change preserves and works within\nthe existing program, be dispositive. Cf. post, at 49\u201350 (opinion of\nGINSBURG, J.). Take, for example, the following hypothetical amend-\nment: \u201cAll of a State\u2019s citizens are now eligible for Medicaid.\u201d That\nchange would take up a single line and would not alter any \u201coperational\naspect[ ] of the program\u201d beyond the eligibility requirements. Post, at\n49. Yet it could hardly be argued that such an amendment was a\npermissible modification of Medicaid, rather than an attempt to foist an\nentirely new health care system upon the States.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          53\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   Here, the Government claims that the Medicaid expan-\nsion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the ex-\nisting program because the States agreed that Congress\ncould change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on\nin the first place. The Government observes that the\nSocial Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid\nprovisions, contains a clause expressly reserving \u201c[t]he\nright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u201d of that\nstatute. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304. So it does. But \u201cif Congress\nintends to impose a condition on the grant of federal mon-\neys, it must do so unambiguously.\u201d Pennhurst, 451 U. S.,\nat 17. A State confronted with statutory language reserv-\ning the right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the pertinent provisions\nof the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that\nCongress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medi-\ncaid program as it developed. Congress has in fact done\nso, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other\ntimes both old and new. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-\nments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1381\u20131382, 1465 (extending Med-\nicaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new\nfunding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,\n\u00a74601, 104 Stat. 1388\u2013166 (extending eligibility, and\nconditioning old and new funds).\n   The Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift\nin kind, not merely degree. The original program was de-\nsigned to cover medical services for four particular cat-\negories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly,\nand needy families with dependent children. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10). Previous amendments to Medicaid\neligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of\nthese categories. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid\nis transformed into a program to meet the health care\nneeds of the entire nonelderly population with income\nbelow 133 percent of the poverty level. It is no longer a\nprogram to care for the neediest among us, but rather an\nelement of a comprehensive national plan to provide uni-\n54         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nversal health insurance coverage.14\n   Indeed, the manner in which the expansion is struc-\ntured indicates that while Congress may have styled the\nexpansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recog-\nnized it was enlisting the States in a new health care\nprogram. Congress created a separate funding provision\nto cover the costs of providing services to any person\nmade newly eligible by the expansion. While Congress pays\n50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals cur-\nrently enrolled in Medicaid, \u00a71396d(b), once the expansion is\nfully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the\ncosts for newly eligible persons, \u00a71396d(y)(1). The condi-\ntions on use of the different funds are also distinct. Con-\ngress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level\nof coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional\nMedicaid benefit package. \u00a71396a(k)(1); see Brief for\nUnited States 9.\n   As we have explained, \u201c[t]hough Congress\u2019 power to\nlegislate under the spending power is broad, it does not\ninclude surprising participating States with postac-\nceptance or \u2018retroactive\u2019 conditions.\u201d Pennhurst, supra, at\n25. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress\u2019s reser-\nvation of the right to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the Medicaid\nprogram included the power to transform it so dramatically.\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that in fact this expansion is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that the States can have no objection to\n\nthe Medicaid expansion, because \u201cCongress could have repealed Medi-\ncaid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new\nprogram combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage\nrequired by the ACA.\u201d Post, at 51; see also post, at 38. But it would\ncertainly not be that easy. Practical constraints would plainly inhibit,\nif not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing\nprogram and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political\nreconsideration. Such a massive undertaking would hardly be \u201critual-\nistic.\u201d Ibid. The same is true of JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s suggestion that\nCongress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.\nPost, at 44.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

J.\n\nno different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such\nthat \u201ca State would be hard put to complain that it lacked\nfair notice.\u201d Post, at 56. But the prior change she dis-\ncusses\u2014presumably the most dramatic alteration she could\nfind\u2014does not come close to working the transformation\nthe expansion accomplishes. She highlights an amend-\nment requiring States to cover pregnant women and in-\ncreasing the number of eligible children. Ibid. But this\nmodification can hardly be described as a major change in\na program that\u2014from its inception\u2014provided health care\nfor \u201cfamilies with dependent children.\u201d Previous Medicaid\namendments simply do not fall into the same category as\nthe one at stake here.\n   The Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to \u201cfix\nthe outermost line\u201d where persuasion gives way to coer-\ncion. 301 U. S., at 591. The Court found it \u201c[e]nough for\npresent purposes that wherever the line may be, this\nstatute is within it.\u201d Ibid. We have no need to fix a line\neither. It is enough for today that wherever that line may\nbe, this statute is surely beyond it. Congress may not\nsimply \u201cconscript state [agencies] into the national bu-\nreaucratic army,\u201d FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775\n(1982) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part), and that is what it is attempting to do\nwith the Medicaid expansion.\n                              B\n  Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering\nfunds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availa-\nbility of health care, and requiring that States accepting\nsuch funds comply with the conditions on their use. What\nCongress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose\nnot to participate in that new program by taking away\ntheir existing Medicaid funding. Section 1396c gives the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to\n56       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v.

It allows her to withhold all \u201cfurther [Medi-\ncaid] payments . . . to the State\u201d if she determines that the\nState is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement,\nincluding those contained in the expansion. 42 U.

In light of the Court\u2019s holding, the Secretary\ncannot apply \u00a71396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds\nfor failure to comply with the requirements set out in the\nexpansion.\n   That fully remedies the constitutional violation we have\nidentified. The chapter of the United States Code that\ncontains \u00a71396c includes a severability clause confirming\nthat we need go no further. That clause specifies that \u201c[i]f\nany provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to\nany person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder\nof the chapter, and the application of such provision to\nother persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\u201d\n\u00a71303. Today\u2019s holding does not affect the continued ap-\nplication of \u00a71396c to the existing Medicaid program. Nor\ndoes it affect the Secretary\u2019s ability to withdraw funds pro-\nvided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has\nchosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with\nthe requirements of that Act.\n   This is not to say, as the joint dissent suggests, that we\nare \u201crewriting the Medicaid Expansion.\u201d Post, at 48.\nInstead, we determine, first, that \u00a71396c is unconstitu-\ntional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds\nfrom States that decline to comply with the expansion.\nWe then follow Congress\u2019s explicit textual instruction to\nleave unaffected \u201cthe remainder of the chapter, and the\napplication of [the challenged] provision to other persons\nor circumstances.\u201d \u00a71303. When we invalidate an applica-\ntion of a statute because that application is unconstitu-\ntional, we are not \u201crewriting\u201d the statute; we are merely\nenforcing the Constitution.\n   The question remains whether today\u2019s holding affects\nother provisions of the Affordable Care Act.

Planned\nParenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320, 330\n(2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question\nhere is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of\nthe Act to stand, had it known that States would have a\ngenuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid\nexpansion. Unless it is \u201cevident\u201d that the answer is no, we\nmust leave the rest of the Act intact. Champlin Refining\nCo. v. Corporation Comm\u2019n of Okla., 286 U. S. 210, 234\n(1932).\n  We are confident that Congress would have wanted to\npreserve the rest of the Act. It is fair to say that Congress\nassumed that every State would participate in the Medi-\ncaid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to\ndo so. The States contend that Congress enacted the rest\nof the Act with such full participation in mind; they point\nout that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying\nthe mandate, 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(f)(1)(A)(ii), and enacted\nno other plan for providing coverage to many low-income\nindividuals. According to the States, this means that the\nentire Act must fall.\n  We disagree. The Court today limits the financial pres-\nsure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept\nthe terms of the Medicaid expansion. As a practical mat-\nter, that means States may now choose to reject the ex-\npansion; that is the whole point. But that does not mean\nall or even any will. Some States may indeed decline to\nparticipate, either because they are unsure they will be\nable to afford their share of the new funding obligations,\nor because they are unwilling to commit the administra-\n58       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                 BUSINESS v.

Other\nStates, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea\nof expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly\ngiven the level of federal funding the Act offers at the\noutset.\n   We have no way of knowing how many States will ac-\ncept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe\nCongress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply\nbecause some may choose not to participate. The other\nreforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain \u201cfully\noperative as a law,\u201d Champlin, supra, at 234, and will still\nfunction in a way \u201cconsistent with Congress\u2019 basic objec-\ntives in enacting the statute,\u201d Booker, supra, at 259.\nConfident that Congress would not have intended any-\nthing different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need\nnot fall in light of our constitutional holding.\n                        *     *   *\n  The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and\nunconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot\nbe upheld as an exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the\nCommerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to\nregulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to\nengage in it. In this case, however, it is reasonable to con-\nstrue what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those\nwho have a certain amount of income, but choose to go\nwithout health insurance. Such legislation is within Con-\ngress\u2019s power to tax.\n  As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Af-\nfordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening\nexisting Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to\norder the States to regulate according to its instructions.\nCongress may offer the States grants and require the\nStates to comply with accompanying conditions, but the\nStates must have a genuine choice whether to accept the\noffer. The States are given no such choice in this case:\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                 59\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

The remedy\nfor that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal\nGovernment from imposing such a sanction. That remedy\ndoes not require striking down other portions of the Af-\nfordable Care Act.\n  The Framers created a Federal Government of limited\npowers, and assigned to this Court the duty of enforcing\nthose limits. The Court does so today. But the Court does\nnot express any opinion on the wisdom of the Affordable\nCare Act. Under the Constitution, that judgment is re-\nserved to the people.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

I would also hold\nthat the Spending Clause permits the Medicaid expansion\nexactly as Congress enacted it.\n                             I\n   The provision of health care is today a concern of na\u00ad\ntional dimension, just as the provision of old-age and\nsurvivors\u2019 benefits was in the 1930\u2019s. In the Social Secu-\nrity Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide\nmonthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually,\nto their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have\nadopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose,\ninstead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and\nstate governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the\nCommerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This\nrigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is\nstunningly retrogressive.\n   Since 1937, our precedent has recognized Congress\u2019\nlarge authority to set the Nation\u2019s course in the economic\nand social welfare realm. See United States v. Darby, 312\nU. S. 100, 115 (1941) (overruling Hammer v. Dagenhart,\n247 U. S. 251 (1918), and recognizing that \u201cregulations of\ncommerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibi-\ntion are within the plenary power conferred on Congress\nby the Commerce Clause\u201d); NLRB v.

THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s crabbed reading of the Commerce Clause\nharks back to the era in which the Court routinely thwarted\nCongress\u2019 efforts to regulate the national economy in\nthe interest of those who labor to sustain it. See, e.g.,\nRailroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330,\n362, 368 (1935) (invalidating compulsory retirement and\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

It is a reading\nthat should not have staying power.\n                             A\n   In enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (ACA), Congress comprehensively reformed the\nnational market for health-care products and services.\nBy any measure, that market is immense. Collectively,\nAmericans spent $2.5 trillion on health care in 2009,\naccounting for 17.6% of our Nation\u2019s economy. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718091(2)(B) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Within the next decade,\nit is anticipated, spending on health care will nearly dou\u00ad\nble. Ibid.\n   The health-care market\u2019s size is not its only distinctive\nfeature. Unlike the market for almost any other product\nor service, the market for medical care is one in which all\nindividuals inevitably participate. Virtually every person\nresiding in the United States, sooner or later, will visit\na doctor or other health-care professional. See Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, National Center for Health\nStatistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults:\nNational Health Interview Survey 2009, Ser. 10, No. 249,\np. 124, Table 37 (Dec. 2010) (Over 99.5% of adults above\n65 have visited a health-care professional.). Most people\nwill do so repeatedly. See id., at 115, Table 34 (In 2009\nalone, 64% of adults made two or more visits to a doctor\u2019s\noffice.).\n   When individuals make those visits, they face another\nreality of the current market for medical care: its high\ncost. In 2010, on average, an individual in the United\nStates incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses.\nDept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medi\u00ad\ncare and Medicaid Services, Historic National Health\n4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

See\nAlemayahu & Warner, The Lifetime Distribution of\nHealth Care Costs, in 39 Health Service Research 627, 635\n(June 2004). When a person requires nonroutine care, the\ncost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.\nA single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs up\u00ad\nwards of $10,000. See Dept. of Health and Human Ser\u00ad\nvices, Office of Health Policy, ASPE Research Brief: The\nValue of Health Insurance 5 (May 2011). Treatments for\nmany serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly\ncost a substantial sum.

S. domiciliary will incur significant\nmedical expenses during his or her lifetime, the time when\ncare will be needed is often unpredictable. An accident, a\nheart attack, or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs with\u00ad\nout warning. Inescapably, we are all at peril of needing\nmedical care without a moment\u2019s notice.

See Con\u00ad\ngressional Budget Office, CBO\u2019s 2011 Long-Term Budget\nOutlook 37 (June 2011).\n   Not all U. S. residents, however, have health insurance.\nIn 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured,\neither by choice or, more likely, because they could not\nafford private insurance and did not qualify for govern\u00ad\nment aid. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, C.\nDeNavas-Walt, B. Proctor, & J. Smith, Income, Poverty,\nand Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009,\np. 23, Table 8 (Sept. 2010). As a group, uninsured individ\u00ad\nuals annually consume more than $100 billion in health-\ncare services, nearly 5% of the Nation\u2019s total.

Over 60% of those without insurance\nvisit a doctor\u2019s office or emergency room in a given year.\nSee Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics, Health\u2014United States\u20142010,\np. 282, Table 79 (Feb. 2011).\n                              B\n  The large number of individuals without health insur\u00ad\nance, Congress found, heavily burdens the national\nhealth-care market. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2). As just\nnoted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a seri\u00ad\nous illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford\nto pay on her own. Unlike markets for most products,\nhowever, the inability to pay for care does not mean that\nan uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and\nstate law, as well as professional obligations and embed\u00ad\nded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to\nprovide care when it is most needed, regardless of the\npatient\u2019s ability to pay. See, e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395dd; Fla.\nStat. \u00a7395.1041(3)(f) (2010); Tex. Health & Safety Code\n6        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

In 2008, for example, hospi-\ntals, physicians, and other health-care professionals\nreceived no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116\nbillion in care they administered to those without insur\u00ad\nance. 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).\n   Health-care providers do not absorb these bad debts.\nInstead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost\nof uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the\ngovernment and private insurance companies. In response,\nprivate insurers increase their premiums, shifting the\ncost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who\ncarry insurance. The net result: Those with health insur\u00ad\nance subsidize the medical care of those without it. As\neconomists would describe what happens, the uninsured\n\u201cfree ride\u201d on those who pay for health insurance.\n   The size of this subsidy is considerable. Congress found\nthat the cost-shifting just described \u201cincreases family\n[insurance] premiums by on average over $1,000 a year.\u201d\nIbid. Higher premiums, in turn, render health insurance\nless affordable, forcing more people to go without insur\u00ad\nance and leading to further cost-shifting.\n   And it is hardly just the currently sick or injured among\nthe uninsured who prompt elevation of the price of health\ncare and health insurance. Insurance companies and\nhealth-care providers know that some percentage of\nhealthy, uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury\neach year and will receive medical care despite their ina\u00ad\nbility to pay. In anticipation of this uncompensated care,\nhealth-care companies raise their prices, and insurers\ntheir premiums. In other words, because any uninsured\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

Because\nthose without insurance generally lack access to preventa\u00ad\ntive care, they do not receive treatment for conditions\u2014\nlike hypertension and diabetes\u2014that can be successfully\nand affordably treated if diagnosed early on. See Institute\nof Medicine, National Academies, Insuring America\u2019s\nHealth: Principles and Recommendations 43 (2004).

An influx of unhealthy individuals\ninto a State with universal health care would result in\nincreased spending on medical services. To cover the\nincreased costs, a State would have to raise taxes, and\nprivate health-insurance companies would have to in\u00ad\ncrease premiums. Higher taxes and increased insurance\ncosts would, in turn, encourage businesses and healthy\nindividuals to leave the State.\n  States that undertake health-care reforms on their own\nthus risk \u201cplacing themselves in a position of economic\ndisadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors.\u201d\nDavis, 301 U.

See\n26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (the minimum\ncoverage provision). As explained below, by employing\nthese tools, Congress was able to achieve a practical, alto\u00ad\ngether reasonable, solution.\n  A central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of\nuninsured U. S. residents. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(C)\nand (I) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The minimum coverage\nprovision advances this objective by giving potential recip\u00ad\nients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insur\u00ad\nance. Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual\nmust either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a\ntax penalty. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A.\n  The minimum coverage provision serves a further pur\u00ad\npose vital to Congress\u2019 plan to reduce the number of unin\u00ad\nsured. Congress knew that encouraging individuals to\npurchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem,\nbecause most of the uninsured are not uninsured by\nchoice.1 Of particular concern to Congress were people\nwho, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot\nacquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical\nconditions.\n  Before the ACA\u2019s enactment, private insurance compa\u00ad\nnies took an applicant\u2019s medical history into account when\nsetting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an\nindividual. Because individuals with preexisting med-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 According to one study conducted by the National Center for Health\n\nStatistics, the high cost of insurance is the most common reason why\nindividuals lack coverage, followed by loss of one\u2019s job, an employer\u2019s\nunwillingness to offer insurance or an insurers\u2019 unwillingness to cover\nthose with preexisting medical conditions, and loss of Medicaid cover\u00ad\nage.

See Dept. of\nHealth and Human Services, Coverage Denied: How the\nCurrent Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind\n1 (2009) (Over the past three years, 12.6 million non\u00ad\nelderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged\nhigher premiums due to a preexisting condition.).\n   To ensure that individuals with medical histories have\naccess to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three\u00ad\npart solution. First, Congress imposed a \u201cguaranteed is\u00ad\nsue\u201d requirement, which bars insurers from denying\ncoverage to any person on account of that person\u2019s medical\ncondition or history. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7300gg\u20131, 300gg\u20133,\n300gg\u20134(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Second, Congress required\ninsurers to use \u201ccommunity rating\u201d to price their insurance\npolicies. See \u00a7300gg. Community rating, in effect, bars\ninsurance companies from charging higher premiums\nto those with preexisting conditions.\n   But these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could\nnot work effectively unless individuals were given a pow\u00ad\nerful incentive to obtain insurance. See Hearings before\nthe House Ways and Means Committee, 111th Cong., 1st\nSess., 10, 13 (2009) (statement of Uwe Reinhardt) (\u201c[I]m-\nposition of community-rated premiums and guaranteed\nissue on a market of competing private health insurers\nwill inexorably drive that market into extinction, unless\nthese two features are coupled with . . . a mandate on\nindividual[s] to be insured.\u201d (emphasis in original)).\n   In the 1990\u2019s, several States\u2014including New York, New\nJersey, Washington, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire,\nand Vermont\u2014enacted guaranteed-issue and community\u00ad\nrating laws without requiring universal acquisition of\ninsurance coverage.

In answering these\nquestions, we presume the statute under review is consti\u00ad\ntutional and may strike it down only on a \u201cplain showing\u201d\nthat Congress acted irrationally. United States v. Morri-\nson, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000).\n                               C\n  Straightforward application of these principles would\nrequire the Court to hold that the minimum coverage\nprovision is proper Commerce Clause legislation. Beyond\ndispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that\nthe uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate\ncommerce. Those without insurance consume billions of\ndollars of health-care products and services each year. See\nsupra, at 5. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered\nlargely by national and regional companies who routinely\ntransact business across state lines. The uninsured also\ncross state lines to receive care. Some have medical emer\u00ad\ngencies while away from home. Others, when sick, go to a\nneighboring State that provides better care for those who\nhave not prepaid for care. See supra, at 7\u20138.\n  Not only do those without insurance consume a large\namount of health care each year; critically, as earlier\nexplained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of\nthat consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on\nother consumers, and reduces market efficiency and sta\u00ad\nbility. See supra, at 5\u20137. Given these far-reaching effects\non interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is\nhardly inconsequential or equivalent to \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d\nante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nhas the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.\nSee supra, at 14\u201316. See also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128\n(\u201cIt is well established by decisions of this Court that\nthe power to regulate commerce includes the power to regu\u00ad\nlate the prices at which commodities in that commerce are\ndealt in and practices affecting such prices.\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   The minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a\n\u201creasonable connection\u201d to Congress\u2019 goal of protecting the\nhealth-care market from the disruption caused by individ\u00ad\nuals who fail to obtain insurance. By requiring those who\ndo not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum cover\u00ad\nage provision gives individuals a strong incentive to in\u00ad\nsure. This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe,\nwould reduce the number of uninsured and, correspond\u00ad\ningly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on\nthe national health-care market.\n   Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured\nindividuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain\ninsurance or to pay the specified penalty. As earlier ob\u00ad\nserved, because every person is at risk of needing care at\nany moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of\ntheir current health status, adversely affect the price of\nhealth care and health insurance. See supra, at 6\u20137.\nMoreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to\nthose in need of immediate care simply could not work.\nInsurance companies would either charge these individu\u00ad\nals prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community\u00ad\nrating regulations were in place, close up shop.

The commerce power does\nnot, THE CHIEF JUSTICE announces, permit Congress\nto \u201ccompe[l] individuals to become active in commerce\nby purchasing a product.\u201d Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).\n                             1\n                             a\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s novel constraint on Congress\u2019\ncommerce power gains no force from our precedent and for\nthat reason alone warrants disapprobation. See infra, at\n23\u201327. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress\nlacks authority under the Commerce Clause to \u201ccompel\nindividuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an\nunwanted product,\u201d ante, at 18, such a limitation would be\ninapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume\nhealth-care products and services. See supra, at 3. Thus,\nif THE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct that an insurance\u00ad\npurchase requirement can be applied only to those who\n\u201cactively\u201d consume health care, the minimum coverage\nprovision fits the bill.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not dispute that all U. S. resi\u00ad\ndents participate in the market for health services over\nthe course of their lives. See ante, at 16 (\u201cEveryone will\neventually need health care at a time and to an extent\nthey cannot predict.\u201d). But, THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists,\nthe uninsured cannot be considered active in the market\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

First, more than\n60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor\u2019s\noffice each year. See supra, at 5. Nearly 90% will within\nfive years.4 An uninsured\u2019s consumption of health care is\nthus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the\nnext five years and more likely than not to occur this year.\n   Equally evident, Congress has no way of separating\nthose uninsured individuals who will need emergency medi-\ncal care today (surely their consumption of medical care\nis sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need\nmedical services for years to come. No one knows when an\nemergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the unin\u00ad\nsured arise daily. To capture individuals who unexpect-\nedly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then,\nCongress needed to include individuals who will not go to\na doctor anytime soon. Congress, our decisions instruct,\nhas authority to cast its net that wide. See Perez v. United\nStates, 402 U. S. 146, 154 (1971) (\u201c[W]hen it is necessary\nin order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more\nthan the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.\u201d (in\u00ad\nternal quotation marks omitted)).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for\n\nHealth Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U.

A victim of an accident or\nunforeseen illness will consume extensive medical care immediately,\nthough scarcely expecting to do so.\n20       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\n   Second, it is Congress\u2019 role, not the Court\u2019s, to delineate\nthe boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to\nregulate. THE CHIEF JUSTICE defines the health-care mar-\nket as including only those transactions that will occur\neither in the next instant or within some (unspecified)\nproximity to the next instant. But Congress could reason\u00ad\nably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective,\nencompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur\nover the next decade, see supra, at 19, not just those oc\u00ad\ncurring here and now.\n   Third, contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s contention, our\nprecedent does indeed support \u201c[t]he proposition that\nCongress may dictate the conduct of an individual today\nbecause of prophesied future activity.\u201d Ante, at 26. In\nWickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Govern\u00ad\nment imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he\nwas permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment\nAct of 1938 (AAA). 317 U. S., at 114\u2013115. He could not\nbe penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the\nwheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open\nmarket. Id., at 119. The Court rejected this argument.\nId., at 127\u2013129. Wheat intended for home consumption,\nthe Court noted, \u201coverhangs the market, and if induced by\nrising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price\nincreases [intended by the AAA].\u201d Id., at 128.\n   Similar reasoning supported the Court\u2019s judgment in\nRaich, which upheld Congress\u2019 authority to regulate mari\u00ad\njuana grown for personal use. 545 U. S., at 19. Home\u00ad\ngrown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar-\nket for marijuana, we observed, for \u201cthe high demand in\nthe interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana\ninto that market.\u201d Ibid.\n   Our decisions thus acknowledge Congress\u2019 authority,\nunder the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an\nindividual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from\ngrowing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          21\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\ncease cultivating marijuana) because of a prophesied\nfuture transaction (the eventual sale of that wheat or\nmarijuana in the interstate market). Congress\u2019 actions\nare even more rational in this case, where the future\nactivity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to\noccur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will\ntake place.\n   Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the\nhealth-care market, THE CHIEF JUSTICE draws an analogy\nto the car market. An individual \u201cis not \u2018active in the car\nmarket,\u2019 \u201d THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, simply because he\nor she may someday buy a car. Ante, at 25. The analogy\nis inapt. The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medi\u00ad\ncal care and the guarantee that emergency care will be\nprovided when required are conditions nonexistent in\nother markets. That is so of the market for cars, and of\nthe market for broccoli as well. Although an individual\nmight buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no\ncertainty she will ever do so. And if she eventually wants\na car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to\npay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nour\u00ad\nishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense\nof another consumer forced to pay an inflated price. See\nThomas More Law Center v. Obama, 651 F. 3d 529, 565\n(CA6 2011) (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (\u201cRegulating\nhow citizens pay for what they already receive (health\ncare), never quite know when they will need, and in the\ncase of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not\nbe able to afford, has few (if any) parallels in modern\nlife.\u201d). Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the\nground that all are participants or will be participants in\nthe health-care market would therefore carry no implica\u00ad\ntion that Congress may justify under the Commerce\nClause a mandate to buy other products and services.\n   Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage\nprovision \u201ccompel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an un\u00ad\n22       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nwanted product,\u201d ante, at 18, or \u201csuite of products,\u201d post, at\n11, n. 2 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and\nALITO, JJ.). If unwanted today, medical service secured by\ninsurance may be desperately needed tomorrow. Virtually\neveryone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point\nin his or her life. See supra, at 3. Health insurance is a\nmeans of paying for this care, nothing more. In requiring\nindividuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not\nmandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.\nRather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which\nindividuals pay for an interstate good they consume:\nPersons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical\ncare in advance (instead of at the point of service) and\nthrough insurance (instead of out of pocket). Establishing\npayment terms for goods in or affecting interstate com\u00ad\nmerce is quintessential economic regulation well within\nCongress\u2019 domain. See, e.g., United States v. Wrightwood\nDairy Co., 315 U. S. 110, 118 (1942). Cf. post, at 13 (joint\nopinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.)\n(recognizing that \u201cthe Federal Government can prescribe\n[a commodity\u2019s] quality . . . and even [its price]\u201d).\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE also calls the minimum coverage\nprovision an illegitimate effort to make young, healthy\nindividuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less\nhale and hardy. See ante, at 17, 25\u201326. This complaint,\ntoo, is spurious. Under the current health-care system,\nhealthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for\nwhich they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need\nit, emergency medical care will be available, although they\ncannot afford it. See supra, at 5\u20136. Those who have in\u00ad\nsurance bear the cost of this guarantee. See ibid. By\nrequiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or\npay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage\nprovision ends the free ride these individuals currently\nenjoy.\n   In the fullness of time, moreover, today\u2019s young and\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Viewed over\na lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who\npay more than their fair share currently will pay less than\ntheir fair share when they become senior citizens. And\neven if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals,\nover their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance\nthan they receive in health services, they have little to\ncomplain about, for that is how insurance works. Every\ninsured person receives protection against a catastrophic\nloss, even though only a subset of the covered class will\nultimately need that protection.\n                               b\n   In any event, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s limitation of the\ncommerce power to the regulation of those actively en\u00ad\ngaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Consti\u00ad\ntution or our decisions. Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution\ngrants Congress the power \u201c[t]o regulate Commerce . . .\namong the several States.\u201d Nothing in this language im-\nplies that Congress\u2019 commerce power is limited to regu-\nlating those actively engaged in commercial transactions.\nIndeed, as the D. C. Circuit observed, \u201c[a]t the time the\nConstitution was [framed], to \u2018regulate\u2019 meant,\u201d among\nother things, \u201cto require action.\u201d See Seven-Sky v. Holder,\n661 F. 3d 1, 16 (2011).\n   Arguing to the contrary, THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that\n\u201cthe Constitution gives Congress the power to \u2018coin\nMoney,\u2019 in addition to the power to \u2018regulate the Value\nthereof,\u2019 \u201d and similarly \u201cgives Congress the power to \u2018raise\nand support Armies\u2019 and to \u2018provide and maintain a Navy,\u2019 in\naddition to the power to \u2018make Rules for the Government\nand Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n18\u201319 (citing Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 5, 12\u201314). In separating the\npower to regulate from the power to bring the subject of\nthe regulation into existence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts,\n\u201c[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural\n24         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nunderstanding that the power to regulate assumes there is\nalready something to be regulated.\u201d Ante, at 19.\n   This argument is difficult to fathom. Requiring individ\u00ad\nuals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter\u00ad\nstate health-insurance and health-care markets, both of\nthem in existence well before the enactment of the ACA.\nSee Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (\u201cThe stimulation of com\u00ad\nmerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely\nas prohibitions or restrictions thereon.\u201d). Thus, the \u201csome\u00ad\nthing to be regulated\u201d was surely there when Congress\ncreated the minimum coverage provision.6\n   Nor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv\u00ad\nity line. In Wickard, for example, we upheld the penalty\nimposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat, even\nthough the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers\nto purchase wheat in the open market. Id., at 127\u2013129.\n\u201c[F]orcing some farmers into the market to buy what they\ncould provide for themselves\u201d was, the Court held, a valid\nmeans of regulating commerce. Id., at 128\u2013129. In an-\nother context, this Court similarly upheld Congress\u2019 author\u00ad\nity under the commerce power to compel an \u201cinactive\u201d land\u00ad\nholder to submit to an unwanted sale. See Monongahela\nNav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 335\u2013337 (1893)\n(\u201c[U]pon the [great] power to regulate commerce[,]\u201d Con\u00ad\ngress has the authority to mandate the sale of real prop-\nerty to the Government, where the sale is essential to the\nimprovement of a navigable waterway (emphasis added));\nCherokee Nation v.

The power\nto \u201cregulate the Value\u201d of the national currency presumably includes\nthe power to increase the currency\u2019s worth\u2014i.e., to create value where\nnone previously existed. And if the power to \u201c[r]egulat[e] . . . the land\nand naval Forces\u201d presupposes \u201cthere is already [in existence] some\u00ad\nthing to be regulated,\u201d i.e., an Army and a Navy, does Congress lack\nauthority to create an Air Force?\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Wickard,\n317 U. S., at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso supra, at 14\u201316. This Court\u2019s former endeavors to\nimpose categorical limits on the commerce power have not\nfared well. In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court\nattempted to cabin Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause authority\nby distinguishing \u201ccommerce\u201d from activity once conceived\nto be noncommercial, notably, \u201cproduction,\u201d \u201cmining,\u201d and\n\u201cmanufacturing.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight\nCo., 156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) (\u201cCommerce succeeds to manu\u00ad\nfacture, and is not a part of it.\u201d); Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,\n298 U. S. 238, 304 (1936) (\u201cMining brings the subject\nmatter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of\nit.\u201d). The Court also sought to distinguish activities hav\u00ad\ning a \u201cdirect\u201d effect on interstate commerce, and for that\nreason, subject to federal regulation, from those having\nonly an \u201cindirect\u201d effect, and therefore not amenable to\nfederal control. See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.\nv. United States, 295 U.

Failing to learn\nfrom this history, THE CHIEF JUSTICE plows ahead with\nhis formalistic distinction between those who are \u201cactive\nin commerce,\u201d ante, at 20, and those who are not.\n   It is not hard to show the difficulty courts (and Con\u00ad\ngress) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg\u00ad\nulate \u201cactivity\u201d from those that regulate \u201cinactivity.\u201d As\nJudge Easterbrook noted, \u201cit is possible to restate most\nactions as corresponding inactions with the same effect.\u201d\nArchie v. Racine, 847 F. 2d 1211, 1213 (CA7 1988) (en\nbanc). Take this case as an example. An individual who\nopts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can\nbe seen as actively selecting another form of insurance:\nself-insurance. See Thomas More Law Center, 651 F. 3d,\nat 561 (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (\u201cNo one is in\u00ad\nactive when deciding how to pay for health care, as self\u00ad\ninsurance and private insurance are two forms of action\nfor addressing the same risk.\u201d). The minimum coverage\nprovision could therefore be described as regulating activ\u00ad\nists in the self-insurance market.7 Wickard is another\nexample. Did the statute there at issue target activity\n(the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer\u2019s\nfailure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)? If any\u00ad\nthing, the Court\u2019s analysis suggested the latter. See 317\nU. S., at 127\u2013129.\n   At bottom, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s and the joint dissent\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s characterization of individuals who choose not\n\nto purchase private insurance as \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d ante, at 20, is simi\u00ad\nlarly questionable. A person who self-insures opts against prepayment for\na product the person will in time consume. When aggregated, exercise\nof that option has a substantial impact on the health-care market.

This concern is unfounded.\n   First, THE CHIEF JUSTICE could certainly uphold the\nindividual mandate without giving Congress carte blanche\nto enact any and all purchase mandates. As several times\nnoted, the unique attributes of the health-care market\nrender everyone active in that market and give rise to a\nsignificant free-riding problem that does not occur in other\nmarkets.

S., at\n567; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617\u2013619. In Lopez, for\nexample, the Court held that the Federal Government\nlacked power, under the Commerce Clause, to criminalize\nthe possession of a gun in a local school zone.

As an example of the type of regulation he\nfears, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites a Government mandate to\npurchase green vegetables. Ante, at 22\u201323. One could call\nthis concern \u201cthe broccoli horrible.\u201d Congress, THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning\nthat an individual\u2019s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the\nfailure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on\nothers. See ibid.\n   Consider the chain of inferences the Court would have\nto accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate\nwas likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care\ncosts borne by lithe Americans. The Court would have to\nbelieve that individuals forced to buy vegetables would\nthen eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away),\nwould prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed\nor raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods,\nand would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise\nor little sleep) to trump the improved diet.9 Such \u201cpil[ing\nof] inference upon inference\u201d is just what the Court re\u00ad\nfused to do in Lopez and Morrison.\n   Other provisions of the Constitution also check congres\u00ad\nsional overreaching. A mandate to purchase a particu-\nlar product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the\nedict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, inter\u00ad\nfered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a\nliberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The failure to purchase vegetables in THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s hypothet\u00ad\n\nical, then, is not what leads to higher health-care costs for others;\nrather, it is the failure of individuals to maintain a healthy diet, and\nthe resulting obesity, that creates the cost-shifting problem. See ante,\nat 22\u201323. Requiring individuals to purchase vegetables is thus\nseveral steps removed from solving the problem. The failure to obtain\nhealth insurance, by contrast, is the immediate cause of the cost-shifting\nCongress sought to address through the ACA. See supra, at 5\u20137.\nRequiring individuals to obtain insurance attacks the source of the\nproblem directly, in a single step.\n30        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                  BUSINESS v.

As the controversy\nsurrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act at\u00ad\ntests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political\nresistance. This prospect is borne out by the behavior of\nstate legislators. Despite their possession of unquestioned\nauthority to impose mandates, state governments have\nrarely done so. See Hall, Commerce Clause Challenges to\nHealth Care Reform, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1825, 1838 (2011).\n   When contemplated in its extreme, almost any power\nlooks dangerous.

SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\n                              V\n   Through Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an\nopportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid\nof federal financing. To receive federal Medicaid funds,\nStates must provide health benefits to specified categories\nof needy persons, including pregnant women, children,\nparents, and adults with disabilities. Guaranteed eligibil\u00ad\nity varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal\npoverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it\ndepends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state\nor federal assistance programs. The ACA enlarges the\npopulation of needy people States must cover to include\nadults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the fed-\neral poverty level. The spending power conferred by the\nConstitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Con\u00ad\ngress to define the contours of programs financed with\nfederal funds. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hos-\npital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981). And to expand\ncoverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legis\u00ad\nlation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as\nembracive of the poor as Congress chose.\n   The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion,\nthen, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger popula\u00ad\ntion, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may\nit achieve the same result by amending existing law? The\nanswer should be that Congress may expand by amend\u00ad\nment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid\nbenefits. A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal\nand reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the\npopulation served by a federally funded program would\nadvance no constitutional principle and would scarcely\nserve the interests of federalism. To the contrary, such a\nrequirement would rigidify Congress\u2019 efforts to empower\nStates by partnering with them in the implementation of\nfederal programs.\n   Medicaid is a prototypical example of federal-state coop\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Rather\nthan authorizing a federal agency to administer a uni-\nform national health-care system for the poor, Con-\ngress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid\ngrants to their particular needs, so long as they remain\nwithin bounds set by federal law. In shaping Medicaid,\nCongress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms\nparticipating states must meet; instead, Congress re\u00ad\nserved the \u201cright to alter, amend, or repeal\u201d any provision\nof the Medicaid Act. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304. States, for their\npart, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent\nwith changes from time to time made in the federal law.\nSee 42 CFR \u00a7430.12(c)(i) (2011). And from 1965 to the\npresent, States have regularly conformed to Congress\u2019\nalterations of the Medicaid Act.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges that Congress may\n\u201ccondition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States\u2019\ncomplying with restrictions on the use of those funds,\u201d\nante, at 50, but nevertheless concludes that the 2010\nexpansion is unduly coercive. His conclusion rests on\nthree premises, each of them essential to his theory. First,\nthe Medicaid expansion is, in THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s view, a\nnew grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid pro\u00ad\ngram existing before the ACA\u2019s enactment. Congress, THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE maintains, has threatened States with the\nloss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them\nto adopt a new one. Second, the expansion was unforesee\u00ad\nable by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.\nThird, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the\nStates have no real choice but to participate in the Medi\u00ad\ncaid expansion. THE CHIEF JUSTICE therefore\u2014for the\nfirst time ever\u2014finds an exercise of Congress\u2019 spending\npower unconstitutionally coercive.\n   Medicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two\nspending programs; it is a single program with a constant\naim\u2014to enable poor persons to receive basic health care\n40       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nwhen they need it. Given past expansions, plus express\nstatutory warning that Congress may change the re\u00ad\nquirements participating States must meet, there can be\nno tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.\nMoreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medi\u00ad\ncaid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds\non Congress\u2019 terms. Future Congresses are not bound\nby their predecessors\u2019 dispositions; they have authority to\nspend federal revenue as they see fit. The Federal Gov\u00ad\nernment, therefore, is not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE charges,\nthreatening States with the loss of \u201cexisting\u201d funds from\none spending program in order to induce them to opt into\nanother program. Congress is simply requiring States to\ndo what States have long been required to do to receive\nMedicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress\nprescribes for participation.\n   A majority of the Court, however, buys the argument\nthat prospective withholding of funds formerly available\nexceeds Congress\u2019 spending power. Given that holding, I\nentirely agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE as to the appropri\u00ad\nate remedy. It is to bar the withholding found impermis\u00ad\nsible\u2014not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap\nthe expansion altogether, see post, at 46\u201348. The dissent\u00ad\ners\u2019 view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical\ndeparture from the Court\u2019s normal course. When a consti\u00ad\ntutional infirmity mars a statute, the Court ordinarily\nremoves the infirmity. It undertakes a salvage operation;\nit does not demolish the legislation. See, e.g., Brockett v.\nSpokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 504 (1985) (Court\u2019s\nnormal course is to declare a statute invalid \u201cto the extent\nthat it reaches too far, but otherwise [to leave the statute]\nintact\u201d). That course is plainly in order where, as in this\ncase, Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave\nuntouched every provision not found invalid. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71303.

Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as\npassed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs\njointly administered with the States.13 States were not\nrequired to participate in Medicaid. But if they did, the\nFederal Government paid at least half the costs. To qual-\nify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of\nhealth coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded,\nstate-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with\nDependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind;\nand Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. See\nSocial Security Amendments of 1965, \u00a7121(a), 79 Stat.\n343; Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U. S. 34, 37 (1981).\nAt their option, States could enroll additional \u201cmedically\nneedy\u201d individuals; these costs, too, were partially borne by\nthe Federal Government at the same, at least 50%, rate.\nIbid.\n   Since 1965, Congress has amended the Medicaid pro\u00ad\ngram on more than 50 occasions, sometimes quite sizably.\nMost relevant here, between 1988 and 1990, Congress\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Medicaid was \u201cplainly an extension of the existing Kerr-Mills\u201d\n\ngrant program.

States have leveraged\nthis policy discretion to generate a myriad of dramatically\ndifferent Medicaid programs over the past several dec\u00ad\nades.\u201d Ruger, Of Icebergs and Glaciers, 75 Law & Con\u00ad\ntemp. Probs. 215, 233 (2012) (footnote omitted). The ACA\ndoes not jettison this approach. States, as first-line ad\u00ad\nministrators, will continue to guide the distribution of\nsubstantial resources among their needy populations.\n   The alternative to conditional federal spending, it bears\nemphasis, is not state autonomy but state marginaliza\u00ad\ntion.16 In 1965, Congress elected to nationalize health\ncoverage for seniors through Medicare. It could similarly\nhave established Medicaid as an exclusively federal pro\u00ad\ngram. Instead, Congress gave the States the opportunity\nto partner in the program\u2019s administration and develop\u00ad\nment. Absent from the nationalized model, of course, is\nthe state-level policy discretion and experimentation that\nis Medicaid\u2019s hallmark; undoubtedly the interests of fed\u00ad\neralism are better served when States retain a meaning-\nful role in the implementation of a program of such\nimportance. See Caminker, State Sovereignty and Sub\u00ad\nordinacy, 95 Colum. L.

That program previously\nhad been operated jointly by the Federal and State Governments, as\nis the case with Medicaid today. Congress replaced the cooperative\nfederal program with the nationalized Supplemental Security In-\ncome (SSI) program. See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U.

In the leading\ndecision in this area, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203\n(1987), the Court identified four criteria. The conditions\nplaced on federal grants to States must (a) promote the\n\u201cgeneral welfare,\u201d (b) \u201cunambiguously\u201d inform States what\nis demanded of them, (c) be germane \u201cto the federal inter\u00ad\nest in particular national projects or programs,\u201d and (d)\nnot \u201cinduce the States to engage in activities that would\nthemselves be unconstitutional.\u201d Id., at 207\u2013208, 210\n(internal quotation marks omitted).18\n   The Court in Dole mentioned, but did not adopt, a fur\u00ad\nther limitation, one hypothetically raised a half-century\nearlier: In \u201csome circumstances,\u201d Congress might be pro\u00ad\nhibited from offering a \u201cfinancial inducement . . . so coer\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 Although the plaintiffs, in the proceedings below, did not contest\nthe ACA\u2019s satisfaction of these criteria, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1263 (CA11\n2011), THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to rely heavily on the second crite-\nrion.

Prior to today\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion, however, the Court has never ruled that the terms of\nany grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation\nand coercion.\n   Dole involved the National Minimum Drinking Age Act,\n23 U. S. C. \u00a7158, enacted in 1984. That Act directed the\nSecretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal\nhighway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State\npermitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons\nless than 21 years old. Drinking age was not within the\nauthority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued,\nbecause the Twenty-First Amendment gave the States\nexclusive power to control the manufacture, transporta\u00ad\ntion, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The small\npercentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota\nstood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to\npurchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as\ncoercion, the Court concluded.\n   This case does not present the concerns that led the\nCourt in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion. In\nDole, the condition\u2014set 21 as the minimum drinking age\u2014\ndid not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro-\nvided for highway construction. Further, in view of the\nTwenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether\nCongress could directly impose a national minimum\ndrinking age.\n   The ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally\nfunded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply,\nCongress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked\nfor any other program. Nor does the ACA use Medicaid\nfunding to induce States to take action Congress itself\ncould not undertake. The Federal Government undoubt\u00ad\nedly could operate its own health-care program for poor\npersons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors\u2019 health\n48       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v.

Congress, aiming to assist\nthe needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize\nstate health-insurance programs that meet federal stand\u00ad\nards. The principal standard the ACA sets is that the\nstate program cover adults earning no more than 133% of\nthe federal poverty line. Enforcing that prescription en\u00ad\nsures that federal funds will be spent on health care for\nthe poor in furtherance of Congress\u2019 present perception of\nthe general welfare.\n                               C\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the Medicaid expan\u00ad\nsion creates a \u201cnew health care program.\u201d Ante, at 54.\nMoreover, States could \u201chardly anticipate\u201d that Congress\nwould \u201ctransform [the program] so dramatically.\u201d Ante,\nat 55. Therefore, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, Congress\u2019\nthreat to withhold \u201cold\u201d Medicaid funds based on a State\u2019s\nrefusal to participate in the \u201cnew\u201d program is a \u201cthrea[t] to\nterminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].\u201d Ante, at 50,\n52\u201353. And because the threat to withhold a large amount\nof funds from one program \u201cleaves the States with no real\noption but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],\u201d THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE concludes, the Medicaid expansion is un\u00ad\nconstitutionally coercive. Ante, at 52.\n                            1\n  The starting premise on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s\ncoercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really\n\u201cextend\u201d Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely\nnew program to co-exist with the old. THE CHIEF JUSTICE\ncalls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of\nAmerica\u2019s poor than Congress originally covered.\n  Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medi\u00ad\ncal assistance to \u201cneedy persons.\u201d See S.

By bring\u00ad\ning health care within the reach of a larger population of\nAmericans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is\nan extension of that basic aim.\n   The Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions gov\u00ad\nerning operation of the program, setting conditions rang\u00ad\ning from \u201cLimitation on payments to States for expend-\nitures attributable to taxes,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(t) (2006\ned.), to \u201cMedical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted\nfor permanent residence,\u201d \u00a71396b(v) (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIV). The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast\nmajority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the\nexisting program and specifies the rate at which States\nwill be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene-\nficiaries. See ACA \u00a7\u00a72001(a)(1), (3), 124 Stat. 271\u2013272.\nThe ACA does not describe operational aspects of the\nprogram for these newly eligible persons; for that infor\u00ad\nmation, one must read the existing Medicaid Act. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71396\u20131396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\n   Congress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expan\u00ad\nsion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a \u201cnew\u201d\nhealth-care program.

S., at 594.\nEven if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress\u2019\nconception of the character of its legislation, how would\nreviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, pur\u00ad\nporting to amend a law, is in reality not an amendment,\nbut a new creation? At what point does an extension\nbecome so large that it \u201ctransforms\u201d the basic law?\n   Endeavoring to show that Congress created a new pro\u00ad\ngram, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites three aspects of the ex\u00ad\npansion. First, he asserts that, in covering those earning\nno more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medi\u00ad\ncaid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not \u201ccare\nfor the neediest among us.\u201d Ante, at 53. What makes\nthat so? Single adults earning no more than $14,856 per\nyear\u2014133% of the current federal poverty level\u2014surely\nrank among the Nation\u2019s poor.\n   Second, according to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, \u201cCongress\nmandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of\ncoverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional\nMedicaid benefit package.\u201d Ibid. That less comprehensive\nbenefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced\nby the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for\nmany of their Medicaid beneficiaries.20 The level of bene\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 Compare Subchapter XIX, 42 U.

Ibid. But the rate differs only in its\ngenerosity to participating States. Under pre-ACA Medi\u00ad\ncaid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs\nof coverage for current enrollees, \u00a71396d(b) (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV); under the ACA, the federal contribution starts\nat 100% and will eventually settle at 90%, \u00a71396d(y).\nEven if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percent\u00ad\nage points carries constitutional significance, is it not\npassing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on\nstate sovereignty might have been averted, or at least\nmitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry\nout the same obligations?\n   Consider also that Congress could have repealed Medi\u00ad\ncaid. See supra, at 38\u201339 (citing 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304); Brief\nfor Petitioners in No. 11\u2013400, p. 41. Thereafter, Congress\ncould have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin\u00ad\ning the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage\nrequired by the ACA. By what right does a court stop\nCongress from building up without first tearing down?\n                             2\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the Medicaid expansion vul\u00ad\nnerable because it took participating States by surprise.\nAnte, at 54. \u201cA State could hardly anticipate that Con\u00ad\ngres[s]\u201d would endeavor to \u201ctransform [the Medicaid pro\u00ad\ngram] so dramatically,\u201d he states.

See \u00a71396a(k).\n52       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nJUSTICE cites only one case: Pennhurst State School and\nHospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1.\n   In Pennhurst, residents of a state-run, federally funded\ninstitution for the mentally disabled complained of abu\u00ad\nsive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged viola\u00ad\ntion of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill\nof Rights Act. 451 U. S., at 5\u20136. We held that the State\nwas not answerable in damages for violating conditions\nit did not \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly accep[t].\u201d Id., at 17,\n27. Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his\u00ad\ntory, we found that the Act did not \u201cunambiguously\u201d im\u00ad\npose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied: that\nthey receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive\nenvironment. Id., at 17\u201318. Satisfied that Congress had\nnot clearly conditioned the States\u2019 receipt of federal funds\non the States\u2019 provision of such treatment, we declined to\nread such a requirement into the Act. Congress\u2019 spending\npower, we concluded, \u201cdoes not include surprising partici\u00ad\npating States with postacceptance or \u2018retroactive\u2019 condi\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Id., at 24\u201325.\n   Pennhurst thus instructs that \u201cif Congress intends to\nimpose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must\ndo so unambiguously.\u201d Ante, at 53 (quoting Pennhurst,\n451 U. S., at 17). That requirement is met in this case.\nSection 2001 does not take effect until 2014. The ACA\nmakes perfectly clear what will be required of States that\naccept Medicaid funding after that date: They must extend\neligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133% of\nthe federal poverty line. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396a(a)(10)(A)\n(i)(VIII) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to find in Pennhurst a\nrequirement that, when spending legislation is first\npassed, or when States first enlist in the federal program,\nCongress must provide clear notice of conditions it might\nlater impose. If I understand his point correctly, it was\nincumbent on Congress, in 1965, to warn the States clearly\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  53\n\n                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nof the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might\ntake. And absent such notice, sizable changes could not be\nmade mandatory. Our decisions do not support such a\nrequirement.21\n   In Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632 (1985), the\nSecretary of Education sought to recoup Title I funds22\nbased on the State\u2019s noncompliance, from 1970 to 1972,\nwith a 1978 amendment to Title I. Relying on Pennhurst,\nwe rejected the Secretary\u2019s attempt to recover funds based\non the States\u2019 alleged violation of a rule that did not exist\nwhen the State accepted and spent the funds. See 470\nU. S., at 640 (\u201cNew Jersey[,] when it applied for and re\u00ad\nceived Title I funds for the years 1970\u20131972[,] had no\nbasis to believe that the propriety of the expenditures\nwould be judged by any standards other than the ones in\neffect at the time.\u201d (citing Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17, 24\u2013\n25; emphasis added)).\n   When amendment of an existing grant program has no\nsuch retroactive effect, however, we have upheld Congress\u2019\ninstruction. In Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S.\n656 (1985), the Secretary sued to recapture Title I funds\nbased on the Commonwealth\u2019s 1974 violation of a spend\u00ad\ning condition Congress added to Title I in 1970. Rejecting\nKentucky\u2019s argument pinned to Pennhurst, we held that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes that \u201cSpending Clause legislation\n\n[i]s much in the nature of a contract.\u201d Ante, at 46 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). See also post, at 33 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY,\nTHOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (same). But the Court previously has rec-\nognized that \u201c[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant\nprograms originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions\nexpressing the judgment of Congress concerning desirable public\npolicy.\u201d Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 669 (1985).\n   22 Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965\n\nprovided federal grants to finance supplemental educational programs\nin school districts with high concentrations of children from low-income\nfamilies. See Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632, 634\u2013635 (1985)\n(citing Pub. L. No. 89\u201310, 79 Stat. 27).\n54       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                 BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n                  Opinion of GINSBURG, J. \n\n\nthe Commonwealth suffered no surprise after accepting\nthe federal funds. Kentucky was therefore obliged to re-\nturn the money. 470 U. S., at 665\u2013666, 673\u2013674. The\nconditions imposed were to be assessed as of 1974, in light\nof \u201cthe legal requirements in place when the grants were\nmade,\u201d id., at 670, not as of 1965, when Title I was origi\u00ad\nnally enacted.\n    As these decisions show, Pennhurst\u2019s rule demands that\nconditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the\ntime a State receives and uses the money\u2014not at the time,\nperhaps years earlier, when Congress passed the law\nestablishing the program. See also Dole, 483 U. S., at 208\n(finding Pennhurst satisfied based on the clarity of the\nFederal Aid Highway Act as amended in 1984, without\nlooking back to 1956, the year of the Act\u2019s adoption).\n    In any event, from the start, the Medicaid Act put\nStates on notice that the program could be changed: \u201cThe\nright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of [Medi\u00ad\ncaid],\u201d the statute has read since 1965, \u201cis hereby reserved\nto the Congress.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71304. The \u201ceffect of these\nfew simple words\u201d has long been settled. See National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R.\nCo., 470 U. S. 451, 467\u2013468, n. 22 (1985) (citing Sinking\nFund Cases, 99 U. S. 700, 720 (1879)). By reserving the\nright to \u201calter, amend, [or] repeal\u201d a spending program,\nCongress \u201chas given special notice of its intention to retain\n. . . full and complete power to make such alterations and\namendments . . . as come within the just scope of legisla\u00ad\ntive power.\u201d Id., at 720.\n    Our decision in Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to\nSocial Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41, 51\u201352 (1986), is\nguiding here. As enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act\ndid not cover state employees. Id., at 44. In response to\npressure from States that wanted coverage for their em\u00ad\nployees, Congress, in 1950, amended the Act to allow\nStates to opt into the program. Id., at 45. The statutory\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           55\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nprovision giving States this option expressly permitted\nthem to withdraw from the program. Ibid.\n   Beginning in the late 1970\u2019s, States increasingly exer\u00ad\ncised the option to withdraw. Id., at 46. Concerned that\nwithdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social\nSecurity, Congress repealed the termination provision.\nCongress thereby changed Social Security from a program\nvoluntary for the States to one from which they could not\nescape. Id., at 48. California objected, arguing that the\nchange impermissibly deprived it of a right to withdraw\nfrom Social Security. Id., at 49\u201350. We unanimously\nrejected California\u2019s argument. Id., at 51\u201353. By includ\u00ad\ning in the Act \u201ca clause expressly reserving to it \u2018[t]he\nright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision\u2019 of the Act,\u201d\nwe held, Congress put States on notice that the Act\n\u201ccreated no contractual rights.\u201d Id., at 51\u201352. The States\ntherefore had no law-based ground on which to complain\nabout the amendment, despite the significant character of\nthe change.\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE nevertheless would rewrite \u00a71304\nto countenance only the \u201cright to alter somewhat,\u201d or\n\u201camend, but not too much.\u201d Congress, however, did not so\nqualify \u00a71304. Indeed, Congress retained discretion to\n\u201crepeal\u201d Medicaid, wiping it out entirely. Cf. Delta Air\nLines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 368 (1981) (Rehnquist,\nJ., dissenting) (invoking \u201cthe common-sense maxim that\nthe greater includes the lesser\u201d). As Bowen indicates, no\nState could reasonably have read \u00a71304 as reserving to\nCongress authority to make adjustments only if modestly\nsized.\n   In fact, no State proceeded on that understanding. In com\u00ad\npliance with Medicaid regulations, each State expressly\nundertook to abide by future Medicaid changes. See 42\nCFR \u00a7430.12(c)(1) (2011) (\u201cThe [state Medicaid] plan must\nprovide that it will be amended whenever necessary to\nreflect . . . [c]hanges in Federal law, regulations, policy\n56         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

Whenever a State\nnotifies the Federal Government of a change in its own\nMedicaid program, the State certifies both that it knows\nthe federally set terms of participation may change, and\nthat it will abide by those changes as a condition of con\u00ad\ntinued participation. See, e.g., Florida Agency for Health\nCare Admin., State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act Medical Assistance Program \u00a77.1, p. 86 (Oct.\n6, 1992).\n   THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists that the most recent expan\u00ad\nsion, in contrast to its predecessors, \u201caccomplishes a shift\nin kind, not merely degree.\u201d Ante, at 53. But why was\nMedicaid altered only in degree, not in kind, when Con\u00ad\ngress required States to cover millions of children and\npregnant women? See supra, at 41\u201342. Congress did not\n\u201cmerely alte[r] and expan[d] the boundaries of \u201d the Aid to\nFamilies with Dependent Children program. But see ante,\nat 53\u201355. Rather, Congress required participating States\nto provide coverage tied to the federal poverty level (as it\nlater did in the ACA), rather than to the AFDC program.\nSee Brief for National Health Law Program et al. as Amici\nCuriae 16\u201318. In short, given \u00a71304, this Court\u2019s con\u00ad\nstruction of \u00a71304\u2019s language in Bowen, and the enlarge\u00ad\nment of Medicaid in the years since 1965,23 a State would\nbe hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when,\nin 2010, Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger\nportion of the Nation\u2019s poor.\n                             3\n     THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately asks whether \u201cthe finan\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  23 Note, in this regard, the extension of Social Security, which began\n\nin 1935 as an old-age pension program, then expanded to include sur-\nvivor benefits in 1939 and disability benefits in 1956.

S., at 591, \u201cwhere persua\u00ad\nsion gives way to coercion,\u201d ante, at 55. Neither do the\njoint dissenters.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nrecognizes Congress\u2019 authority to construct a single federal program\nand \u201ccondition the receipt of funds on the States\u2019 complying with\nrestrictions on the use of those funds.\u201d Ante, at 50. For the joint\ndissenters, however, all that matters, it appears, is whether States can\nresist the temptation of a given federal grant. Post, at 35. On this\nlogic, any federal spending program, sufficiently large and well-funded,\nwould be unconstitutional. The joint dissenters point to smaller pro\u00ad\ngrams States might have the will to refuse. See post, at 40\u201341 (elemen\u00ad\ntary and secondary education). But how is a court to judge whether\n\u201conly 6.6% of all state expenditures,\u201d post, at 41, is an amount States\ncould or would do without?\n   Speculations of this genre are characteristic of the joint dissent. See,\ne.g., post, at 35 (\u201cit may be state officials who will bear the brunt of\npublic disapproval\u201d for joint federal-state endeavors); ibid., (\u201cfederal\nofficials . . . may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of\ntheir decision\u201d); post, at 37 (\u201ca heavy federal tax . . . levied to support a\nfederal program that offers large grants to the States . . . may, as a\npractical matter, [leave States] unable to refuse to participate\u201d); ibid.\n(withdrawal from a federal program \u201cwould likely force the State to\nimpose a huge tax increase\u201d); post, at 46 (state share of ACA expansion\ncosts \u201cmay increase in the future\u201d) (all emphasis added; some internal\nquotation marks omitted).

Ante, at 48. Are courts to\nmeasure the number of dollars the Federal Government\nmight withhold for noncompliance? The portion of the\nState\u2019s budget at stake? And which State\u2019s\u2014or States\u2019\u2014\nbudget is determinative: the lead plaintiff, all challenging\nStates (26 in this case, many with quite different fiscal\nsituations), or some national median? Does it matter that\nFlorida, unlike most States, imposes no state income tax,\nand therefore might be able to replace foregone federal\nfunds with new state revenue?26 Or that the coercion state\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npossibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\u201d). We should not lightly\nascribe to Congress an intent to violate the Constitution (at least as my\ncolleagues read it). This is particularly true when the ACA could just\nas well be comprehended as demonstrating Congress\u2019 mere expectation,\nin light of the uniformity of past participation and the generosity of the\nfederal contribution, that States would not withdraw. Cf. South Dakota\nv. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 211 (1987) (\u201cWe cannot conclude . . . that a con\u00ad\nditional grant of federal money . . . is unconstitutional simply by\nreason of its success in achieving the congressional objective.\u201d).\n   26 Federal taxation of a State\u2019s citizens, according to the joint dissent\u00ad\n\ners, may diminish a State\u2019s ability to raise new revenue. This, in turn,\ncould limit a State\u2019s capacity to replace a federal program with an\n\u201cequivalent\u201d state-funded analog. Post, at 40.

Even commentators\nsympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole\u2019s limitations,\nsee supra, at 46, have concluded that conceptions of\n\u201cimpermissible coercion\u201d premised on States\u2019 perceived\ninability to decline federal funds \u201care just too amorphous\nto be judicially administrable.\u201d Baker & Berman, Getting\noff the Dole, 78 Ind.

Rev. 1175 (1989)).\n   At bottom, my colleagues\u2019 position is that the States\u2019\nreliance on federal funds limits Congress\u2019 authority to\nalter its spending programs. This gets things backwards:\nCongress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal\nmoney in service of the general welfare. And each succes\u00ad\nsive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees\nfit. When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about\nMedicaid funds that differed from its predecessors\u2019 view,\nit abridged no State\u2019s right to \u201cexisting,\u201d or \u201cpre-existing,\u201d\nfunds.

There is only money States\nanticipate receiving from future Congresses.\n                               D\n  Congress has delegated to the Secretary of Health and\nHuman Services the authority to withhold, in whole or\nin part, federal Medicaid funds from States that fail to\ncomply with the Medicaid Act as originally composed and as\nsubsequently amended. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396c.27 THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE, however, holds that the Constitution precludes\nthe Secretary from withholding \u201cexisting\u201d Medicaid funds\nbased on States\u2019 refusal to comply with the expanded Medi\u00ad\ncaid program. Ante, at 55. For the foregoing reasons, I\ndisagree that any such withholding would violate the\nSpending Clause. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision\nof the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this\nregard.\n  But in view of THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s disposition, I agree\nwith him that the Medicaid Act\u2019s severability clause de\u00ad\ntermines the appropriate remedy. That clause provides\nthat \u201c[i]f any provision of [the Medicaid Act], or the appli\u00ad\ncation thereof to any person or circumstance, is held in-\nvalid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of\nsuch provision to other persons or circumstances shall not\nbe affected thereby.\u201d 42 U.

See ante, at 51. But total\nwithdrawal is what the Secretary may, not must, do. She has discre\u00ad\ntion to withhold only a portion of the Medicaid funds otherwise due a\nnoncompliant State. See \u00a71396c; cf. 45 CFR \u00a780.10(f) (2011) (Secretary\nmay enforce Title VI\u2019s nondiscrimination requirement through \u201crefusal\nto grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part.\u201d\n(emphasis added)). The Secretary, it is worth noting, may herself\nexperience political pressures, which would make her all the more\nreluctant to cut off funds Congress has appropriated for a State\u2019s needy\ncitizens.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

It prohibits only the \u201capplication\u201d of the Secretary\u2019s\nauthority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that\ndecline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA\u2019s\nrequirements. Thus the ACA\u2019s authorization of funds to\nfinance the expansion remains intact, and the Secretary\u2019s\nauthority to withhold funds for reasons other than non\u00ad\ncompliance with the expansion remains unaffected.\n   Even absent \u00a71303\u2019s command, we would have no war\u00ad\nrant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion, contra post, at\n46\u201348 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and\nALITO, JJ.), not to mention the entire ACA, post, at 49\u201364\n(same). For when a court confronts an unconstitutional\nstatute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy,\nthe legislature\u2019s dominant objective. See, e.g., Ayotte v.\nPlanned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S. 320,\n328\u2013330 (2006). In this case, that objective was to in\u00ad\ncrease access to health care for the poor by increasing the\nStates\u2019 access to federal funds. THE CHIEF JUSTICE is\nundoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer\nStates funds \u201cto expand the availability of health care, and\nrequir[e] that States accepting such funds comply with the\nconditions on their use.\u201d Ante, at 55. I therefore concur\nin the judgment with respect to Part IV\u2013B of THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE\u2019s opinion.\n                        *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE\nthat, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi\u00ad\nsion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision en-\ncounters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would\nuphold the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision that the Medicaid\nexpansion is within Congress\u2019 spending power.\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

It can assuredly do that, by exercis-\ning the powers accorded to it under the Constitution. The\nquestion in this case, however, is whether the complex\nstructures and provisions of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go be-\nyond those powers. We conclude that they do.\n  This case is in one respect difficult: it presents two\n2       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nquestions of first impression. The first of those is whether\nfailure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of\nhealth insurance) is subject to regulation under the Com-\nmerce Clause. Failure to act does result in an effect\non commerce, and hence might be said to come under\nthis Court\u2019s \u201caffecting commerce\u201d criterion of Commerce\nClause jurisprudence. But in none of its decisions has this\nCourt extended the Clause that far. The second question\nis whether the congressional power to tax and spend,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1, permits the conditioning of\na State\u2019s continued receipt of all funds under a massive\nstate-administered federal welfare program upon its ac-\nceptance of an expansion to that program. Several of our\nopinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend\ncannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal\nprogram, but we have never found a law enacted under\nthe spending power to be coercive. Those questions are\ndifficult.\n  The case is easy and straightforward, however, in an-\nother respect. What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the\ntext of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment\nratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the\n220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon\nfederal power\u2014upon what it can prescribe with respect to\nprivate conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the\nsovereign States. Whatever may be the conceptual limits\nupon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax\nand spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal\nGovernment to regulate all private conduct and to com-\npel the States to function as administrators of federal\nprograms.\n  That clear principle carries the day here. The striking\ncase of Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), which\nheld that the economic activity of growing wheat, even\nfor one\u2019s own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently\nthat it could be regulated, always has been regarded as\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nthe ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurispru-\ndence. To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow\nwheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity\nat all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be\nfederally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out\nthe basis for federal prescription and to extend federal\npower to virtually all human activity.\n  As for the constitutional power to tax and spend for\nthe general welfare: The Court has long since expanded\nthat beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and\nspending for those aspects of the general welfare that were\nwithin the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers,\nsee United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 65\u201366 (1936).\nThus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted\nto subjects not mentioned among Congress\u2019 enumerated\npowers, and only marginally related to commerce: the De-\npartment of Education, the Department of Health and\nHuman Services, the Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment. The principal practical obstacle that pre-\nvents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to\nassume all the general-welfare responsibilities tradition-\nally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of\nmanaging a Federal Government large enough to adminis-\nter such a system. That obstacle can be overcome by\ngranting funds to the States, allowing them to administer\nthe program. That is fair and constitutional enough when\nthe States freely agree to have their powers employed and\ntheir employees enlisted in the federal scheme. But it is a\nblatant violation of the constitutional structure when the\nStates have no choice.\n  The Act before us here exceeds federal power both in\nmandating the purchase of health insurance and in deny-\ning nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding. These\nparts of the Act are central to its design and operation,\nand all the Act\u2019s other provisions would not have been\nenacted without them. In our view it must follow that the\n4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nentire statute is inoperative.\n                               I\n                 The Individual Mandate\n   Article I, \u00a78, of the Constitution gives Congress the\npower to \u201cregulate Commerce . . . among the several\nStates.\u201d The Individual Mandate in the Act commands\nthat every \u201capplicable individual shall for each month\nbeginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any\ndependent of the individual who is an applicable individ-\nual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.\u201d 26\nU. S. C. \u00a75000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). If this provision\n\u201cregulates\u201d anything, it is the failure to maintain mini-\nmum essential coverage. One might argue that it regu-\nlates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by\npayment of a penalty. But that failure\u2014that abstention\nfrom commerce\u2014is not \u201cCommerce.\u201d To be sure, purchas-\ning insurance is \u201dCommerce\u201d; but one does not regulate\ncommerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.\n   In Gibbons v.

SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nitself. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718091(2)(H).\n   As discussed in more detail in Part V, infra, the Act\ncontains numerous health insurance reforms, but most\nnotable for present purposes are the \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d\nand \u201ccommunity rating\u201d provisions, \u00a7\u00a7300gg to 300gg\u20134.\nThe former provides that, with a few exceptions, \u201ceach\nhealth insurance issuer that offers health insurance cov-\nerage in the individual or group market in a State must\naccept every employer and individual in the State that\napplies for such coverage.\u201d \u00a7300gg\u20131(a). That is, an in-\nsurer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other\nthings, any pre-existing medical condition that the appli-\ncant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover\nthat condition. See \u00a7300gg\u20133.\n   Under ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would\nrespond by charging high premiums to individuals with\npre-existing conditions. The Act seeks to prevent this\nthrough the community-rating provision. Simply put, the\ncommunity-rating provision requires insurers to calculate\nan individual\u2019s insurance premium based on only four\nfactors: (i) whether the individual\u2019s plan covers just\nthe individual or his family also, (ii) the \u201crating area\u201d in\nwhich the individual lives, (iii) the individual\u2019s age, and\n(iv) whether the individual uses tobacco. \u00a7300gg(a)(1)(A).\nAside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and\npossibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to\nfactor the individual\u2019s health characteristics into the price\nof his insurance premium. This creates a new incentive\nfor young and healthy individuals without pre-existing\nconditions. The insurance premiums for those in this\ngroup will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will\nsubsidize insurance for others in the pool. Many of them\nmay decide that purchasing health insurance is not an eco-\nnomically sound decision\u2014especially since the guaranteed-\nissue provision will enable them to purchase it at the\nsame cost in later years and even if they have developed a\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             7\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\npre-existing condition. But without the contribution of\nabove-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the\ncommunity-rating provision will not enable insurers to\ntake on high-risk individuals without a massive increase\nin premiums.\n    The Government presents the Individual Mandate as a\nunique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme govern-\ning many parties with countervailing incentives that must\nbe carefully balanced. Congress has imposed an extensive\nset of regulations on the health insurance industry, and\ncompliance with those regulations will likely cost the in-\ndustry a great deal. If the industry does not respond by\nincreasing premiums, it is not likely to survive. And if\nthe industry does increase premiums, then there is a seri-\nous risk that its products\u2014insurance plans\u2014will become\neconomically undesirable for many and prohibitively ex-\npensive for the rest.\n    This is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health-\ninsurance industry.       Government regulation typically\nimposes costs on the regulated industry\u2014especially regu-\nlation that prohibits economic behavior in which most\nmarket participants are already engaging, such as \u201cpiec-\ning out\u201d the market by selling the product to different\nclasses of people at different prices (in the present context,\nproviding much lower insurance rates to young and\nhealthy buyers). And many industries so regulated face\nthe reality that, without an artificial increase in demand,\nthey cannot continue on. When Congress is regulating\nthese industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to\nenact \u201c \u2018all appropriate legislation\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018protec[t]\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201c \u2018advanc[e]\u2019 \u201d commerce, NLRB v.

Congress\u2019 desire to\nforce these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated\nby the fact that they are further removed from the market\nthan unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions,\nbecause they are less likely to need extensive care in\nthe near future. If Congress can reach out and command\neven those furthest removed from an interstate market to\nparticipate in the market, then the Commerce Clause\nbecomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton\u2019s words,\n\u201cthe hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare\nneither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor pro-\nfane.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, p. 202 (C.

And\nthe last two of these cases show that the scope of the\nNecessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when\nthe congressional action directly violates the sovereignty\nof the States but also when it violates the background\nprinciple of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.\n   The case upon which the Government principally relies\nto sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary\nand Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005).\nThat case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain\nthe interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultiva-\ntion and possession of that drug. Id., at 15\u201322. Raich\nis no precedent for what Congress has done here. That\ncase\u2019s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, 317 U. S. 111),\nand of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not\nrepresent the expansion of the federal power to direct into\na broad new field. The mandating of economic activity\ndoes, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the\nCommerce Clause into a general authority to direct the\neconomy, that mandating is not \u201cconsist[ent] with the\nletter and spirit of the constitution.\u201d McCulloch v.

The Court\u2019s opinion in Raich\npointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions\nwere the only practicable way of enabling the prohibition\nof interstate traffic in marijuana to be effectively enforced.\n545 U.

Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979).\n  With the present statute, by contrast, there are many\nways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate\nby which the regulatory scheme\u2019s goals of reducing insur-\nance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers\ncould be achieved. For instance, those who did not pur-\nchase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when\nthey do enter the health insurance system. Or they could\nbe denied a full income tax credit given to those who do\npurchase the insurance.\n  The Government was invited, at oral argument, to\nsuggest what federal controls over private conduct (other\nthan those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or\nother constitutional controls) could not be justified as\nnecessary and proper for the carrying out of a general\nregulatory scheme. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27\u201330, 43\u201345\n(Mar. 27, 2012). It was unable to name any. As we said at\nthe outset, whereas the precise scope of the Commerce\nClause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain,\nthe proposition that the Federal Government cannot do\neverything is a fundamental precept. See Lopez, 514 U. S.,\nat 564 (\u201c[I]f we were to accept the Government\u2019s argu-\nments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an in-\ndividual that Congress is without power to regulate\u201d).\nSection 5000A is defeated by that proposition.\n                              B\n  The Government\u2019s second theory in support of the In-\ndividual Mandate is that \u00a75000A is valid because it is\nactually a \u201cregulat[ion of] activities having a substantial\nrelation to interstate commerce, . . . i.e., . . . activities that\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce.\u201d Id., at 558\u2013559.\nSee also Shreveport Rate Cases, supra.

That is,\nthe provision directs the manner in which individuals\npurchase health care services and related goods (directing\nthat they be purchased through insurance) and is there-\nfore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power.\n  The primary problem with this argument is that \u00a75000A\ndoes not apply only to persons who purchase all, or most,\nor even any, of the health care services or goods that the\nmandated insurance covers. Indeed, the main objection\nmany have to the Mandate is that they have no intention\nof purchasing most or even any of such goods or services\nand thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases.\nThe Government responds that the health-care market\ninvolves \u201cessentially universal participation,\u201d id., at 35.\nThe principal difficulty with this response is that it is, in\nthe only relevant sense, not true. It is true enough that\neveryone consumes \u201chealth care,\u201d if the term is taken to\ninclude the purchase of a bottle of aspirin. But the health\ncare \u201cmarket\u201d that is the object of the Individual Mandate\nnot only includes but principally consists of goods and\nservices that the young people primarily affected by the\nMandate do not purchase. They are quite simply not\nparticipants in that market, and cannot be made so (and\nthereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of\ndefining participants to include all those who will, later in\ntheir lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services\ncovered by the mandated insurance.2 Such a definition of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE GINSBURG is therefore right to note that Congress is \u201cnot\n\nmandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.\u201d Ante, at 22\n(opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dis-\n12        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v.

But as the discussion above makes clear, the\ndecision to forgo participation in an interstate market is\nnot itself commercial activity (or indeed any activity at all)\nwithin Congress\u2019 power to regulate. It is true that, at the\nend of the day, it is inevitable that each American will\naffect commerce and become a part of it, even if not by\nchoice. But if every person comes within the Commerce\nClause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason\nthat he will one day engage in commerce, the idea of a\nlimited Government power is at an end.\n   Wickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most ex-\npansive assertion of the commerce power in our history. A\nclose second is Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971),\nwhich upheld a statute criminalizing the eminently local\nactivity of loan-sharking. Both of those cases, however,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsenting in part). Instead, it is mandating the purchase of an unwanted\nsuite of products\u2014e.g., physician office visits, emergency room visits,\nhospital room and board, physical therapy, durable medical equipment,\nmental health care, and substance abuse detoxification. See Selected\nMedical Benefits: A Report from the Dept. of Labor to the Dept. of\nHealth & Human Services (April 15, 2011) (reporting that over two-\nthirds of private industry health plans cover these goods and services),\nonline at http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/sp/selmedbensreport.pdf (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 26, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file).\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

To go beyond that, and to\nsay that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make\nloans affects commerce, so that growing and lending can\nbe federally compelled, is to extend federal power to virtu-\nally everything. All of us consume food, and when we do\nso the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality\nmust be and even how much we must pay. But the mere\nfact that we all consume food and are thus, sooner or later,\nparticipants in the \u201cmarket\u201d for food, does not empower\nthe Government to say when and what we will buy. That\nis essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the\npurchase of health care. It exceeds federal power.\n                               C\n    A few respectful responses to JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s dis-\nsent on the issue of the Mandate are in order. That dis-\nsent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that\nour opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the\ntest contains. It is true enough that Congress needs only a\n\u201c \u2018rational basis\u2019 for concluding that the regulated activity\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce,\u201d ante, at 15 (em-\nphasis added). But it must be activity affecting com-\nmerce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to\nengage in commerce. And one is not now purchasing\nthe health care covered by the insurance mandate simply\nbecause one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our\ntest\u2019s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of\nwhole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution\u2019s requirement\nthat it be commerce which is regulated. If all inactivity\naffecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.\nUltimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is\nreally no difference between action and inaction, ante, at\n26, a proposition that has never recommended itself,\nneither to the law nor to common sense. To say, for exam-\nple, that the inaction here consists of activity in \u201cthe self-\ninsurance market,\u201d ibid., seems to us wordplay.

It threatens that order\nbecause it gives such an expansive meaning to the Com-\nmerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to\nact) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroy-\ning the Constitution\u2019s division of governmental powers.\nThus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity\nof the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional\nrelation between the individual and the National Govern-\nment. The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper\nClause has been held to include \u201cthe power to enact crimi-\nnal laws, . . . the power to imprison, . . . and the power to\ncreate a national bank,\u201d ante, at 34\u201335. Is not the power\nto compel purchase of health insurance much lesser? No,\nnot if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests\nupon a theory that everything is within federal control\nsimply because it exists.\n   The dissent\u2019s exposition of the wonderful things the Fed-\neral Government has achieved through exercise of its\nassigned powers, such as \u201cthe provision of old-age and\nsurvivors\u2019 benefits\u201d in the Social Security Act, ante, at 2,\nis quite beside the point. The issue here is whether the\nfederal government can impose the Individual Mandate\nthrough the Commerce Clause. And the relevant history\nis not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful\nresults through the proper exercise of its assigned powers\nin the past, but that it has never before used the Com-\nmerce Clause to compel entry into commerce.3 The dissent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 In   its effort to show the contrary, JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019S dissent comes\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

It enumerates not federally\nsoluble problems, but federally available powers. The\nFederal Government can address whatever problems it\nwants but can bring to their solution only those powers\nthat the Constitution confers, among which is the power to\nregulate commerce. None of our cases say anything else.\nArticle I contains no whatever-it-takes-to-solve-a-national-\nproblem power.\n  The dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to\ncompel entry into the health-insurance market would\ninclude the power to compel entry into the new-car or\nbroccoli markets. The latter purchasers, it says, \u201cwill be\nobliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nup with nothing more than two condemnation cases, which it says\ndemonstrate \u201cCongress\u2019 authority under the commerce power to compel\nan \u2018inactive\u2019 landholder to submit to an unwanted sale.\u201d Ante, at 24.\nWrong on both scores. As its name suggests, the condemnation power\ndoes not \u201ccompel\u201d anyone to do anything. It acts in rem, against the\nproperty that is condemned, and is effective with or without a transfer\nof title from the former owner. More important, the power to condemn\nfor public use is a separate sovereign power, explicitly acknowledged in\nthe Fifth Amendment, which provides that \u201cprivate property [shall not]\nbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d\n  Thus, the power to condemn tends to refute rather than support\nthe power to compel purchase of unwanted goods at a prescribed price:\nThe latter is rather like the power to condemn cash for public use. If it\nexisted, why would it not (like the condemnation power) be accompa-\nnied by a requirement of fair compensation for the portion of the\nexacted price that exceeds the goods\u2019 fair market value (here, the\ndifference between what the free market would charge for a health-\ninsurance policy on a young, healthy person with no pre-existing\nconditions, and the government-exacted community-rated premium)?\n16       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

Those differences make a very good argument\nby the dissent\u2019s own lights, since they show that the fail-\nure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to\npurchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare\nproblem that is (in the dissent\u2019s view) included among the\nunenumerated \u201cproblems\u201d that the Constitution author-\nizes the Federal Government to solve. But those differences\ndo not show that the failure to enter the health-insurance\nmarket, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is\nan activity that Congress can \u201cregulate.\u201d (Of course one\nday the failure of some of the public to purchase Amer-\nican cars may endanger the existence of domestic automo-\nbile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli\nmay be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer-\nfighting chemical which only that food contains, producing\nhealth-care costs that are a burden on the rest of us\u2014in\nwhich case, under the theory of JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s dis-\nsent, moving against those inactivities will also come\nwithin the Federal Government\u2019s unenumerated problem-\nsolving powers.)\n                            II\n                     The Taxing Power\n  As far as \u00a75000A is concerned, we would stop there.\nCongress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

In\nall our cases the two are mutually exclusive. The provi-\nsion challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty\nor else a tax.

Section\n5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the defini-\ntion of \u201capplicable individual\u201d subject to the minimum\ncoverage requirement: Those with religious objections or\nwho participate in a \u201chealth care sharing ministry,\u201d\n\u00a75000A(d)(2); those who are \u201cnot lawfully present\u201d in the\nUnited States, \u00a75000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcer-\nated, \u00a75000A(d)(4). Section 5000A(e) then creates a sepa-\nrate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the\npenalty certain individuals who are subject to the mini-\nmum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford\ncoverage, \u00a75000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to re-\nquire filing a tax return, \u00a75000A(e)(2); who are members\nof an Indian tribe, \u00a75000A(e)(3); who experience only short\ngaps in coverage, \u00a75000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment\nof the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \u201chave\nsuffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain\ncoverage,\u201d \u00a75000A(e)(5). If \u00a75000A were a tax, these two\nclasses of exemption would make no sense; there being no\nrequirement, all the exemptions would attach to the pen-\nalty (renamed tax) alone.\n   In the face of all these indications of a regulatory re-\nquirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General\nassures us that \u201cneither the Treasury Department nor the\n22       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

These self-\nserving litigating positions are entitled to no weight.\nWhat counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely\nclear. It is worth noting, moreover, that these assurances\ncontradict the Government\u2019s position in related litigation.\nShortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the\nCommonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann. \u00a738.2\u2013\n3430.1:1 (Lexis Supp. 2011), which states, \u201cNo resident of\n[the] Commonwealth . . . shall be required to obtain or\nmaintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except\nas required by a court or the Department of Social Ser-\nvices . . . .\u201d In opposing Virginia\u2019s assertion of standing to\nchallenge \u00a75000A based on this statute, the Government\nsaid that \u201cif the minimum coverage provision is unconsti-\ntutional, the [Virginia] statute is unnecessary, and if the\nminimum coverage provision is upheld, the state statute is\nvoid under the Supremacy Clause.\u201d Brief for Appellant\nin No. 11\u20131057 etc. (CA4), p. 29.

It is not.\nSee, e.g., 26 U. S. C. \u00a7527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible pen-\nalty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures);\n\u00a75761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of to-\nbacco products labeled for export); \u00a79707 (IRS-collectible\npenalty for failure to make required health-insurance\npremium payments on behalf of mining employees). In\nReorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 518 U. S.\n213, we held that an exaction not only enforced by the\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a \u201ctax\u201d\nwas in fact a penalty. \u201c[I]f the concept of penalty means\nanything,\u201d we said, \u201cit means punishment for an unlawful\nact or omission.\u201d Id., at 224. See also Lipke v. Lederer,\n259 U. S. 557 (1922) (same). Moreover, while the penalty\nis assessed and collected by the IRS, \u00a75000A is adminis-\ntered both by that agency and by the Department of\nHealth and Human Services (and also the Secretary of\nVeteran Affairs), see \u00a75000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v),\n(f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for\ndefining its substantive scope\u2014a feature that would be\nquite extraordinary for taxes.\n   The Government points out that \u201c[t]he amount of the\npenalty will be calculated as a percentage of household\nincome for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor\nand [a] ca[p],\u201d and that individuals who earn so little\nmoney that they \u201care not required to file income tax re-\nturns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty\u201d\n(though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the\nmandate).

C. \u00a72716a(a).\n  The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petition-\ners that we will address is the contention that what this\nstatute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it\ncontains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a\nrequirement suggests a penalty\u2014though one can imagine\na tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of\nsuch a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for\nabsolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a\nstatute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume\na mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a \u201csevere\npenalty.\u201d Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 618\n(1994). Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing\nwhen it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred\nfrom a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a\npenalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter\nrequirement.\n  And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and pen-\nalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core,\nrather than where a tax would be found\u2014in Title IX,\ncontaining the Act\u2019s \u201cRevenue Provisions.\u201d In sum, \u201cthe\nterms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,\u201d Parsons v.\nBedford, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/rtj/parsons-v-bedford/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a\nregulatory penalty, not a tax.\n  For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Man-\ndate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute\nbut to rewrite it.

Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act\nof 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution\nrequires tax increases to originate in the House of Repre-\nsentatives. See Art.

The\nFederalist No. 58 \u201cdefend[ed] the decision to give the\norigination power to the House on the ground that the\nChamber that is more accountable to the people should\nhave the primary role in raising revenue.\u201d United States\nv. Munoz-Flores, 495 U. S. 385, 395 (1990). We have no\ndoubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing\nwhen it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that\nimposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. See\nAffordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th\nCong., 1st Sess., \u00a7501 (2009); America\u2019s Healthy Future\nAct of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a71301. Impos-\ning a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitu-\ntional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of\ngovernment least accountable to the citizenry.\n   Finally, we must observe that rewriting \u00a75000A as a tax\nin order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to\nconfront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is\na direct tax that must be apportioned among the States\naccording to their population. Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 4. Perhaps it\nis not (we have no need to address the point); but the\nmeaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and\nits application here is a question of first impression that\ndeserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-\na-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.\nThe Government\u2019s opening brief did not even address the\nquestion\u2014perhaps because, until today, no federal court\nhas accepted the implausible argument that \u00a75000A is\nan exercise of the tax power. And once respondents raised\nthe issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its\nreply brief to the issue. Petitioners\u2019 Minimum Coverage\nReply Brief 25.

S. C. \u00a77421(a) (2006 ed.).\n  We have left the question to this point because it\nseemed to us that the dispositive question whether the\nminimum-coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately\naddressed in the significant constitutional context of\nwhether it is an exercise of Congress\u2019 taxing power. Hav-\ning found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding\nthat these suits do not have \u201cthe purpose of restraining\nthe assessment or collection of any tax.\u201d6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The amicus appointed to defend the proposition that the Anti-\n\nInjunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction stresses that the penalty for\nfailing to comply with the mandate \u201cshall be assessed and collected\nin the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of\nchapter 68,\u201d 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and that\nsuch penalties \u201cshall be assessed and collected in the same manner\nas taxes,\u201d \u00a76671(a) (2006 ed.). But that point seems to us to confirm\nthe inapplicability of the Anti-Injunction Act. That the penalty is to\nbe \u201cassessed and collected in the same manner as taxes\u201d refutes the\nproposition that it is a tax for all statutory purposes, including with\nrespect to the Anti-Injunction Act. Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal\nRevenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment\nshall be \u201cassessed and collected\u201d in the same manner as a tax and that\nno suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of\nthe payment. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a77421(b)(1), \u00a76901(a); \u00a76305(a), (b). The\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

The rhetorical device that\ntries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is\nthe same device employed in arguing that for constitu-\ntional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax:\nconfusing the question of what Congress did with the\nquestion of what Congress could have done. What quali-\nfies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike\nwhat qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is\nentirely within the control of Congress. Compare Bailey v.\nGeorge, 259 U. S. 16, 20 (1922) (Anti-Injunction Act barred\nsuit to restrain collections under the Child Labor Tax\nLaw), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S., at 36\u201341\n(holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Con-\ngress\u2019 taxing power). Congress could have defined \u201ctax\u201d\nfor purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude\nsome exactions that in fact are \u201ctaxes.\u201d It might have\nprescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the\ntaxing power \u201cshall not be regarded as a tax for purposes\nof the Anti-Injunction Act.\u201d But there is no such prescrip-\ntion here. What the Government would have us believe in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nlatter directive would be superfluous if the former invoked the Anti-\nInjunction Act.\n  Amicus also suggests that the penalty should be treated as a tax\nbecause it is an assessable penalty, and the Code\u2019s assessment provi-\nsion authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess \u201call taxes (in-\ncluding interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and as-\nsessable penalties) imposed by this title.\u201d \u00a76201(a) (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV). But the fact that such items are included as \u201ctaxes\u201d for purposes of\nassessment does not establish that they are included as \u201ctaxes\u201d for\npurposes of other sections of the Code, such as the Anti-Injunction Act,\nthat do not contain similar \u201cincluding\u201d language.\n28        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v.

For\nthe average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is\nequal to more than one-fifth of the State\u2019s expenditures.7\nA State forced out of the program would not only lose this\nhuge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to\nincrease its own health-care expenditures substantially,\nrequiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other\nprograms or a large increase in state taxes. And these\nnew taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already\npaid by the State\u2019s citizens to fund the Medicaid program\nin other States.\n  The States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA\u2019s\nMedicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical\nreasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at\nall.

C. \u00a718091(2)(D), and\nwithout 100% State participation in the Medicaid pro-\ngram, attainment of this goal would be thwarted. Even if\nStates could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program,\nwhile declining to participate in the Expansion, there\nwould be a gaping hole in coverage. And if a substantial\nnumber of States were entirely expelled from the program,\nthe number of persons without coverage would be even\nhigher.\n   In light of the ACA\u2019s goal of near-universal coverage,\npetitioners argue, if Congress had thought that anything\nless than 100% state participation was a realistic possibil-\nity, Congress would have provided a backup scheme. But\nno such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than\n900 pages of the Act. This shows, they maintain, that\nCongress was certain that the ACA\u2019s Medicaid offer was\none that no State could refuse.\n   In response to this argument, the Government contends\nthat any congressional assumption about uniform state\nparticipation was based on the simple fact that the offer\nof federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is\nsuch a generous gift that no State would want to turn it\ndown.\n   To evaluate these arguments, we consider the extent of\nthe Federal Government\u2019s power to spend money and to\nattach conditions to money granted to the States.\n                              A\n    No one has ever doubted that the Constitution author-\nizes the Federal Government to spend money, but for\nmany years the scope of this power was unsettled.

Writing for\nthe Court, Justice Roberts opined that the Madisonian\nview would make Article I\u2019s grant of the spending power a\n\u201cmere tautology.\u201d Ibid. To avoid that, he adopted Hamil-\nton\u2019s approach and found that \u201cthe power of Congress to\nauthorize expenditure of public moneys for public pur-\nposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative\npower found in the Constitution.\u201d Id., at 66. Instead, he\nwrote, the spending power\u2019s \u201cconfines are set in the clause\nwhich confers it, and not in those of section 8 which be-\nstow and define the legislative powers of the Congress.\u201d\nIbid.; see also Steward Machine Co. v.

For one thing, any\nsuch conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at\nleast knows what it is getting into. See Pennhurst, supra,\nat 17.

And just as a contract\nis voidable if coerced, \u201c[t]he legitimacy of Congress\u2019 power\nto legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether\nthe State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms\nof the \u2018contract.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

Congress may not \u201csimply commandeer the legisla-\ntive processes of the States by directly compelling them to\nenact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\u201d Id.,\nat 161 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\nCongress effectively engages in this impermissible com-\npulsion when state participation in a federal spending\nprogram is coerced, so that the States\u2019 choice whether to\nenact or administer a federal regulatory program is ren-\ndered illusory.\n   Where all Congress has done is to \u201cencourag[e] state\nregulation rather than compe[l] it, state governments\nremain responsive to the local electorate\u2019s preferences;\nstate officials remain accountable to the people. [But]\nwhere the Federal Government compels States to regulate,\nthe accountability of both state and federal officials is\ndiminished.\u201d New York, supra, at 168.\n   Amici who support the Government argue that forcing\nstate employees to implement a federal program is more\nrespectful of federalism than using federal workers to\nimplement that program. See, e.g., Brief for Service Em-\nployees International Union et al. as Amici Curiae in No.\n11\u2013398, pp. 25\u201326. They note that Congress, instead of\nexpanding Medicaid, could have established an entirely\nfederal program to provide coverage for the same group of\npeople. By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative\nfederal-state program, they contend, Congress allows for\nmore state control. Ibid.\n   This argument reflects a view of federalism that our\ncases have rejected\u2014and with good reason. When Con-\ngress compels the States to do its bidding, it blurs the\nlines of political accountability. If the Federal Govern-\nment makes a controversial decision while acting on its\nown, \u201cit is the Federal Government that makes the deci-\nsion in full view of the public, and it will be federal offi-\ncials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out\nto be detrimental or unpopular.\u201d New York, 505 U.

But when the Federal Government compels the\nStates to take unpopular actions, \u201cit may be state officials\nwho will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the\nfederal officials who devised the regulatory program may\nremain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their\ndecision.\u201d Id., at 169; see Printz, supra, at 930. For this\nreason, federal officeholders may view this \u201cdepartur[e]\nfrom the federal structure to be in their personal interests\n. . . as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual\ndecision.\u201d New York, 505 U. S., at 182\u2013183. And even state\nofficials may favor such a \u201cdeparture from the constitu-\ntional plan,\u201d since uncertainty concerning responsibility\nmay also permit them to escape accountability. Id., at\n182. If a program is popular, state officials may claim\ncredit; if it is unpopular, they may protest that they were\nmerely responding to a federal directive.\n    Once it is recognized that spending-power legislation\ncannot coerce state participation, two questions remain:\n(1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context? (2) Is\nthe ACA\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive? We now\nturn to those questions.\n                              D\n                              1\n  The answer to the first of these questions\u2014the meaning\nof coercion in the present context\u2014is straightforward. As\nwe have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions\nto federal grants to the States depends on the voluntari-\nness of the States\u2019 choice to accept or decline the offered\npackage. Therefore, if States really have no choice other\nthan to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the\nconditions cannot be sustained under the spending power.\nAnd as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear,\ntheoretical voluntariness is not enough.\n  In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the\nspending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the\n36      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

South Dakota ar-\ngued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we\ndisagreed, reasoning that \u201cCongress ha[d] directed only\nthat a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age\nlower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain\nfederal highway funds.\u201d 483 U. S., at 211. Because \u201call\nSouth Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen\ncourse as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5%\nof the funds otherwise obtainable under specified high-\nway grant programs,\u201d we found that \u201cCongress ha[d] of-\nfered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact\nhigher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise\nchoose.\u201d Ibid. Thus, the decision whether to comply with\nthe federal condition \u201cremain[ed] the prerogative of the\nStates not merely in theory but in fact,\u201d and so the pro-\ngram at issue did not exceed Congress\u2019 power. Id., at 211\u2013\n212 (emphasis added).\n  The question whether a law enacted under the spending\npower is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but\nwhere Congress has plainly \u201ccrossed the line distinguish-\ning encouragement from coercion,\u201d New York, supra, at\n175, a federal program that coopts the States\u2019 political\nprocesses must be declared unconstitutional. \u201c[T]he fed-\neral balance is too essential a part of our constitutional\nstructure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for\nus to admit inability to intervene.\u201d Lopez, 514 U. S., at\n578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n                              2\n   The Federal Government\u2019s argument in this case at best\npays lip service to the anticoercion principle. The Federal\nGovernment suggests that it is sufficient if States are\n\u201cfree, as a matter of law, to turn down\u201d federal funds.\nBrief for Respondents in No. 11\u2013400, p. 17 (emphasis\nadded); see also id., at 25.

Id., at 41\u201346.\n   This argument ignores reality. When a heavy federal\ntax is levied to support a federal program that offers large\ngrants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be\nunable to refuse to participate in the federal program and\nto substitute a state alternative. Even if a State believes\nthat the federal program is ineffective and inefficient,\nwithdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge\ntax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would\ncome on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents\nto support subsidies to participating States.13\n   Acceptance of the Federal Government\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dic-\ntate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the\nstate or local level. Suppose, for example, that Congress\nenacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the\nState\u2019s entire annual expenditures for primary and sec-\nondary education. Suppose also that this funding came\nwith conditions governing such things as school curricu-\nlum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of\nschool districts, the length and hours of the school day, the\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 JUSTICE GINSBURG argues that \u201c[a] State . . . has no claim on the\n\nmoney its residents pay in federal taxes.\u201d Ante, at 59, n. 26. This is\ntrue as a formal matter. \u201cWhen the United States Government taxes\nUnited States citizens, it taxes them \u2018in their individual capacities\u2019 as\n\u2018the people of America\u2019\u2014not as residents of a particular State.\u201d Ante, at\n58, n. 26 (quoting U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,\n839 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring)). But unless JUSTICE GINSBURG\nthinks that there is no limit to the amount of money that can be\nsqueezed out of taxpayers, heavy federal taxation diminishes the\npractical ability of States to collect their own taxes.\n38       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

As a matter of law, a State could turn\ndown that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not\nonly be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support\nthis expensive new program, but they would also be forced\nto pay an equivalent amount in state taxes. And if the\nState gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivi-\nsions would surrender their traditional authority in the\nfield of education.

In this case, however, there\ncan be no doubt. In structuring the ACA, Congress unam-\nbiguously signaled its belief that every State would have\nno real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expan-\nsion. If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case,\nthen there is no such rule.\n                               1\n   The dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong\nsupport to the petitioner States\u2019 argument that refusing to\naccede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realis-\ntic option. Before the ACA\u2019s enactment, Medicaid funded\nmedical care for pregnant women, families with depend-\nents, children, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled. See\n42 U. S.

But the\nsheer size of this federal spending program in relation to\nstate expenditures means that a State would be very hard\npressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by\ncutting other spending or raising additional revenue.\nArizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expendi-\ntures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government\nto provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third\nof Arizona\u2019s annual state expenditures of $17 billion. See\nNASBO Report 7, 47. Therefore, if Arizona lost federal\nMedicaid funding, the State would have to commit an\nadditional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an\nequivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion\nMedicaid. This means that the State would have to allo-\ncate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.\nSee ibid.\n  The States are far less reliant on federal funding for any\nother program.

See ibid. In Arizona,\nfor example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are\nequal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education\nfunds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures. See\nibid. And even in States with less than average federal\nMedicaid funding, that funding is at least twice the size of\nfederal education funding as a percentage of state expend-\nitures. Id., at 7, 16, 47.\n   A State forced out of the Medicaid program would face\nburdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid fund-\ning. For example, a nonparticipating State might be found\nto be ineligible for other major federal funding sources,\nsuch as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),\nwhich is premised on the expectation that States will\nparticipate in Medicaid. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(3) (2006\ned.) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be\n\u201celigible for medical assistance under the State[\u2019s Medi-\ncaid] plan\u201d). And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medi-\ncaid program would not relieve a State\u2019s hospitals of their\nobligation under federal law to provide care for patients\nwho are unable to pay for medical services. The Emer-\ngency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, \u00a71395dd,\nrequires hospitals that receive any federal funding to\nprovide stabilization care for indigent patients but does\nnot offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out\nits mandate. Many of these patients are now covered by\nMedicaid. If providers could not look to the Medicaid\nprogram to pay for this care, they would find it exceed-\ningly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were\ngiven substantial state support. See, e.g., Brief for Econ-\nomists as Amici Curiae in No 11\u2013400, p. 11.\n   For these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the\nStates\u2014go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or\n42      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v.

In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount\nthat the States would have lost if every single State\nhad refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking\nage was approximately $614.7 million\u2014or about 0.19%\nof all state expenditures combined.       See Nat. Assn.\nof State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987\u2013\n1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989),\nhttp://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditure-\nreport/archives. South Dakota stood to lose, at most,\nfunding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state\nexpenditures. See ibid. Under the ACA, by contrast, the\nFederal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of\nall federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233\nbillion. See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47. South Dakota\nstands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual\nstate expenditures. See id., at 7, 47. Withholding $614.7\nmillion, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures\ncombined, is aptly characterized as \u201crelatively mild en-\ncouragement,\u201d but threatening to withhold $233 billion,\nequaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a\ndifferent matter.\n                              2\n  What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal\nand structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress\nclearly expressed its informed view that no State could\npossibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.\n  The stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care\ncoverage. To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that\nevery person obtain a minimum level of coverage. It at-\ntempts to reach this goal in several different ways. The\nguaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are\ndesigned to make qualifying insurance available and\naffordable for persons with medical conditions that may\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             43\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nrequire expensive care. Other ACA provisions seek to\nmake such policies more affordable for people of modest\nmeans.     Finally, for low-income individuals who are\nsimply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded\nMedicaid, transforming it from a program covering only\nmembers of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a pro-\ngram that provides at least the requisite minimum level\nof coverage for the poor. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71396a(a)\n(10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 1396u\u20137(a), (b)(5),\n18022(a). This design was intended to provide at least\na specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans,\nbut the achievement of that goal obviously depends on\nparticipation by every single State. If any State\u2014not\nto mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit\u2014\nchose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping\nhole in the ACA\u2019s coverage.\n  It is true that some persons who are eligible for Medi-\ncaid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private\ninsurance, either through their employers or by obtain-\ning subsidized insurance through an exchange. See 26\nU. S. C. \u00a736B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respond-\nents in No. 11\u2013400, at 12. But the new federal subsidies\nare not available to those whose income is below the fed-\neral poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other\nthan Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage\nand comply with the Mandate. The Government counters\nthat these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e.g.,\nTr. of Oral Arg. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents\nin No. 11\u2013400, at 49\u201350, but that argument misses the\npoint: Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have\ncoverage and the ACA\u2019s goal of near-universal coverage\nwill be severely frustrated.\n  If Congress had thought that States might actually\nrefuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Con-\ngress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that\nthe most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously\n44       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\neligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold. But\nnowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be\nfound. By contrast, because Congress thought that some\nStates might decline federal funding for the operation of\na \u201chealth benefit exchange,\u201d Congress provided a backup\nscheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation\nof an exchange, the Federal Government will step in\nand operate an exchange in that State. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a718041(c)(1). Likewise, knowing that States would not\nnecessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens\nlawfully present in the United States\u2014because Medicaid\ndoes not require States to provide such coverage\u2014Con-\ngress extended the availability of the new federal insur-\nance subsidies to all aliens. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a736B(c)\n(1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals\nwho are \u201cnot eligible for the medicaid program . . . by\nreason of [their] alien status\u201d). Congress did not make\nthese subsidies available for citizens with incomes below\nthe poverty level because Congress obviously assumed\nthat they would be covered by Medicaid. If Congress had\ncontemplated that some of these citizens would be left\nwithout Medicaid coverage as a result of a State\u2019s with-\ndrawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely\nwould have made them eligible for the tax subsidies pro-\nvided for low-income aliens.\n   These features of the ACA convey an unmistakable\nmessage: Congress never dreamed that any State would\nrefuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid. Con-\ngress well understood that refusal was not a practical\noption.\n   The Federal Government does not dispute the inference\nthat Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it\nargues that this assumption was based on the fact that\nACA\u2019s offer was an \u201cexceedingly generous\u201d gift. Brief for\nRespondents in No. 11\u2013400, at 50. As the Federal Gov-\nernment sees things, Congress is like the generous bene-\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n            45\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nfactor who offers $1 million with few strings attached to\n50 randomly selected individuals. Just as this benefactor\nmight assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap\nup his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would\ngratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go\nwith the expansion of Medicaid.\n   This characterization of the ACA\u2019s offer raises obvious\nquestions. If that offer is \u201cexceedingly generous,\u201d as the\nFederal Government maintains, why have more than half\nthe States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer\nis coercive? And why did Congress find it necessary to\nthreaten that any State refusing to accept this \u201cexceed-\ningly generous\u201d gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds?\nCongress could have made just the new funding provided\nunder the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of\nthe Medicaid Expansion. Congress took such an approach\nin some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new\ncoverage requirements and funding from the rest of the\nprogram so that only new funding was conditioned on new\neligibility extensions. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-\nments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1465.\n   Congress\u2019 decision to do otherwise here reflects its un-\nderstanding that the ACA offer is not an \u201cexceedingly\ngenerous\u201d gift that no State in its right mind would de-\ncline. Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very\nsubstantial costs on participating States. It is true that\nthe Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs\nassociated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying\n100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals\nbetween 2014 and 2016. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71396d(y). But that\nis just part of the picture. Participating States will be\nforced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after\n2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the\ncosts associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state\nspending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by\n2020 as a consequence.

After 2019,\nstate spending is expected to increase at a faster rate; the\nCBO estimates new state spending at $60 billion through\n2021. Statement of Douglas W. Elmendorf, supra, at 24.\nAnd these costs may increase in the future because of\nthe very real possibility that the Federal Government will\nchange funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds\nit will cover. This would leave the States to bear an in-\ncreasingly large percentage of the bill. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 74\u201376 (Mar. 28, 2012). Finally, after 2015, the States\nwill have to pick up the tab for 50% of all administrative\ncosts associated with implementing the new program, see\n\u00a7\u00a71396b(a)(2)\u2013(5), (7) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), costs that could\napproach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020,\nsee Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Medi-\ncaid and Medicare Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the\nFinancial Outlook for Medicaid 30.\n   In sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure\nof the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was\none that Congress understood no State could refuse. The\nMedicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress\u2019 spending\npower and cannot be implemented.\n                             F\n  Seven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid\nExpansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional.\nSee Part IV\u2013A to IV\u2013E, supra; Part IV\u2013A, ante, at 45\u201355\n(opinion of ROBERTS, C. J., joined by BREYER and KAGAN,\nJJ.). Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional,\nthe question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             47\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\nwould be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However,\nthe Government proposes\u2014in two cursory sentences at\nthe very end of its brief\u2014preserving the Expansion. Under\nits proposal, States would receive the additional Medi-\ncaid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would\nkeep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not\nexpand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government\u2019s\nsuggestion.\n   The reality that States were given no real choice but to\nexpand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed\nStates would have no choice, and the ACA depends on\nStates\u2019 having no choice, because its Mandate requires\nlow-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them\ncan afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Fur-\nthermore, a State\u2019s withdrawal might subject everyone in\nthe State to much higher insurance premiums. That is\nbecause the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the\ncost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA\u2019s in-\nsurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in\nmore detail in the severability section below. To make the\nMedicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA\u2019s structure\nand design \u201c \u2018would be to make a new law, not to enforce\nan old one. This is no part of our duty.\u2019 \u201d Trade-Mark\nCases, 100 U. S. 82, 99 (1879).\n   Worse, the Government\u2019s proposed remedy introduces a\nnew dynamic: States must choose between expanding\nMedicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for\nthe sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If\nthis divisive dynamic between and among States can be\nintroduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional\nchoice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not\ndoubt that States are capable of making decisions when\nput in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this\nCourt to put them there.\n   The Government cites a severability clause codified with\nMedicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating\n48        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                     BUSINESS v.

S. C. \u00a71303 (2006 ed.). But that\nclause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7\nshould not be invalidated if \u00a71396c, the authorization for\nthe cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional. It\ndoes not tell us that \u00a71396c can be judicially revised, to\nsay what it does not say. Such a judicial power would\nnot be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps\nthe doctrine of amendatory invalidation\u2014similar to the\namendatory veto that permits the Governors of some\nStates to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.\nThe proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that\nit would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but\nwould leave it up to the Court what the \u201cvalidated\u201d legis-\nlation will contain. The Court today opts for permitting\nthe cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it\nmight just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds\nthat represent no more than x percent of the State\u2019s bud-\nget. The Court severs nothing, but simply revises \u00a71396c to\nread as the Court would desire.\n   We should not accept the Government\u2019s invitation to\nattempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the\nMedicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it\nto retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds. Worse, the\nGovernment\u2019s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes\nthe ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a\ncourse for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has\nchosen; but under the Constitution, that power and au-\nthority do not rest with this Court.\n                           V\n                      Severability\n     The Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve \u201cnear-\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

The two pillars of the Act are the Individ-\nual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.\nIn our view, both these central provisions of the Act\u2014the\nIndividual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\u2014are invalid.\nIt follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provi-\nsions of the Act must fall as well. The following section\nexplains the severability principles that require this con-\nclusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated\nthe Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial\nusurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for\nwithdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV\u2013F, supra,\nwhich is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act\nalters its dynamics.\n                                A\n   When an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a\nmore comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the\nvalidity of the remaining provisions. The Court\u2019s author-\nity to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been\nwell established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137\n(1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provi-\nsion from the Judiciary Act of 1789. And while the Court\nhas sometimes applied \u201cat least a modest presumption in\nfavor of . . . severability,\u201d C. Nelson, Statutory Interpreta-\ntion 144 (2010), it has not always done so, see, e.g., Minne-\nsota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U. S.\n172, 190\u2013195 (1999).\n   An automatic or too cursory severance of statutory\nprovisions risks \u201crewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an\neffect altogether different from that sought by the meas-\nure viewed as a whole.\u201d Railroad Retirement Bd. v.

That\ncan be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than\nstriking the whole statute and allowing Congress to ad-\ndress the conditions that pertained when the statute was\nconsidered at the outset.\n   The Court has applied a two-part guide as the frame-\nwork for severability analysis. The test has been deemed\n\u201cwell established.\u201d Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480\nU. S. 678, 684 (1987). First, if the Court holds a statutory\nprovision unconstitutional, it then determines whether\nthe now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con-\ngress intended. If not, the remaining provisions must be\ninvalidated. See id., at 685. In Alaska Airlines, the Court\nclarified that this first inquiry requires more than ask-\ning whether \u201cthe balance of the legislation is incapable of\nfunctioning independently.\u201d Id., at 684. Even if the re-\nmaining provisions will operate in some coherent way,\nthat alone does not save the statute. The question is\nwhether the provisions will work as Congress intended.\nThe \u201crelevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether\nthe statute will function in a manner consistent with\nthe intent of Congress.\u201d Id., at 685 (emphasis in original).\nSee also Free Enterprise Fund v.

Under the\nseverability test set out above, it must be determined if\nthose provisions function in a coherent way and as Con-\ngress would have intended, even when the major provi-\nsions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid\nExpansion are themselves invalid.\n   Congress did not intend to establish the goal of near-\nuniversal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.\nSee, e.g., ACA \u00a71563, 124 Stat. 270 (\u201c[T]his Act will reduce\nthe Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019\u201d). And it did\nnot intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one indus-\ntry or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act\nis to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set\nof regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to\nobtain health insurance. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a75000A(a).

C. \u00a718071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV)\n(federal subsidies). The Federal Government\u2019s increased\nspending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal\nexpenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in\nfederal payments to hospitals. See, e.g., \u00a71395ww(r) (Med-\nicare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, 124 Stat. 847 (\u201cRev-\nenue Offset Provisions\u201d). Employers with at least 50\nemployees must either provide employees with adequate\nhealth benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee\nwho qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance\nthrough an exchange. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a74980H (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV).\n   In short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal\nhealth insurance coverage by spreading its costs to indi-\nviduals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers\u2014\nwhile, at the same time, offsetting significant portions\nof those costs with new benefits to each group. For ex-\nample, the Federal Government bears the burden of pay-\ning billions for the new entitlements mandated by the\nMedicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance\npurchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reduc-\ntions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals. Hospi-\ntals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the\ndecrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance\nregulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing\nconditions to purchase coverage that increases payments\nto hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed\nby a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including\n\u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating\u201d requirements\nto give coverage regardless of the insured\u2019s pre-existing\nconditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy\npurchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate\nto buy the insurers\u2019 product and from the new low-\nincome Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance\ncompanies\u2019 Medicaid-funded managed care programs.

So, the Act\u2019s major provisions\nare interdependent.\n  The Act then refers to these interdependencies as\n\u201cshared responsibility.\u201d See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, 124\nStat. 242 (\u201cShared Responsibility\u201d); ACA \u00a71501, ibid.\n(same); ACA \u00a71513, id., at 253 (same); ACA \u00a74980H, ibid.\n(same).

To be sure, an argument\ncan be made that those portions of the Act that none of the\nparties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonse-\nverable. The response to this argument is that our cases\ndo not support it. See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co.\nof La., 278 U.

It would take years, perhaps\ndecades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated sepa-\nrately\u2014and for some of them (those simply expending\nfederal funds) no one may have separate standing. The\nFederal Government, the States, and private parties ought\nto know at once whether the entire legislation fails.\n   The opinion now explains in Part V\u2013C\u20131, infra, why the\nAct\u2019s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate\nand Medicaid Expansion. It proceeds from the insurance\nregulations and taxes (C\u20131\u2013a), to the reductions in reim-\nbursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions\n(C\u20131\u2013b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C\u20131\u2013c),\nand the employer responsibility assessment (C\u20131\u2013d).\nPart V\u2013C\u20132, infra, explains why the Act\u2019s minor provi-\nsions also are not severable.\n                             1\n               The Act\u2019s Major Provisions\n  Major provisions of the Affordable Care Act\u2014i.e., the\ninsurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal\nreimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spend-\ning reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies,\nand the employer responsibility assessment\u2014cannot remain\nonce the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are\ninvalid. That result follows from the undoubted inability\nof the other major provisions to operate as Congress in-\ntended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid\nExpansion. Absent the invalid portions, the other major\nprovisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected bur-\ndens on patients, the health-care community, and the\nfederal budget.

What is known, however, is\nthat severing other provisions from the Individual Man-\ndate and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose\nsignificant risks and real uncertainties on insurance com-\npanies, their customers, all other major actors in the sys-\ntem, and the government treasury. And what also is\nknown is this: Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertain-\nties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability\nand thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the\nNation\u2019s freedom. If those risks and uncertainties are to\nbe imposed, it must not be by the Judiciary.\n                             b\n   Reductions in Reimbursements to Hospitals and\n      Other Reductions in Medicare Expenditures\n  The Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Fed-\neral Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion\nover 10 years. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)\u2013(xii)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV); \u00a71395ww(q); \u00a71395ww(r); \u00a71396r\u2013\n4(f)(7).\n  The concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage\nwill reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hos-\npitals\u2019 revenues, which will offset the government\u2019s re-\nductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to\nhospitals. Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and\nbenefits balance each other. This is typical of the whole\ndynamic of the Act.\n  Invalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insur-\nance coverage, such as community rating and the Medi-\ncaid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in\nMedicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA\u2019s design of\n\u201cshared responsibility.\u201d Some hospitals may be forced to\nraise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in\nreimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance\npremiums, in contravention of the Act\u2019s goal of \u201clower[ing]\n58       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v.

See also \u00a718091(2)(I) (goal of\n\u201clower[ing] health insurance premiums\u201d); \u00a718091(2)(J)\n(same). Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that\nserve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced\nto shut down. Cf. National Assn. of Public Hospitals, 2009\nAnnual Survey: Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems\nFulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5\u20136 (Feb. 2011). Like\nthe effect of preserving the insurance regulations and\ntaxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknow-\nable. It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing\npart of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose\nunknowable risks that Congress could neither measure\nnor predict. And Congress could not have intended that\nresult in any event.\n   There is a second, independent reason why the reduc-\ntions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA\u2019s other\nMedicare cuts must be invalidated. The ACA\u2019s $455 bil-\nlion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434-\nbillion cost of the Medicaid Expansion. See CBO Esti-\nmate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed\nCongress to find that the ACA \u201cwill reduce the Federal\ndeficit between 2010 and 2019\u201d and \u201cwill continue to\nreduce budget deficits after 2019.\u201d ACA \u00a7\u00a71563(a)(1), (2),\n124 Stat. 270.\n   That finding was critical to the ACA. The Act\u2019s \u201cshared\nresponsibility\u201d concept extends to the federal budget.\nCongress chose to offset new federal expenditures with\nbudget cuts and tax increases. That is why the United\nStates has explained in the course of this litigation that\n\u201c[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure\nthat any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was\noffset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provi-\nsions.\u201d Memorandum in Support of Government\u2019s Motion\nfor Summary Judgment in No. 3\u201310\u2013cv\u201391, p. 41.\n   If the Medicare and Medicaid reductions would no longer\n                   Cite as: 567 U.

They would lose their justification and\nfoundation. In addition, to preserve them would be \u201cto\neliminate a significant quid pro quo of the legislative com-\npromise\u201d and create a statute Congress did not enact.\nLegal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533,\n561 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It is no secret that\ncutting Medicare is unpopular; and it is most improbable\nCongress would have done so without at least the assur-\nance that it would render the ACA deficit-neutral. See\nACA \u00a7\u00a71563(a)(1), (2), 124 Stat. 270.\n                              c\n   Health Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal\n                         Subsidies\n  The ACA requires each State to establish a health-\ninsurance \u201cexchange.\u201d Each exchange is a one-stop mar-\nketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare\ncommunity-rated health insurance and purchase the\npolicy of their choice. The exchanges cannot operate in the\nmanner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate,\nMedicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot\nremain in force.\n  The Act\u2019s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars\nto subsidize individuals\u2019 purchases on the exchanges. In-\ndividuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of\nthe poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of\ninsurance to the individual purchaser. 26 U. S. C. \u00a736B\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. \u00a718071 (2006 ed., Supp.\nIV). By 2019, 20 million of the 24 million people who will\nobtain insurance through an exchange are expected to\nreceive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.\nSee CBO, Analysis of the Major Health Care Legislation\nEnacted in March 2010, pp. 18\u201319 (Mar. 30, 2011). With-\nout the community-rating insurance regulation, however,\n60      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nthe average federal subsidy could be much higher; for\ncommunity rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums\nunhealthy individuals would otherwise pay.          Federal\nsubsidies would make up much of the difference.\n   The result would be an unintended boon to insurance\ncompanies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and\na corresponding breakdown of the \u201cshared responsibil-\nity\u201d between the industry and the federal budget that\nCongress intended. Thus, the federal subsidies must be\ninvalidated.\n   In the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insur-\nance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance\non the exchanges. Under the ACA\u2019s scheme, few, if any,\nindividuals would want to buy individual insurance poli-\ncies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies\nwould be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in\nattracting individuals outside of the exchange would in\nturn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the\nexchanges\u2019 onerous regulations. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a718031.\nThat system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies\nare invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individ-\nuals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance\ninside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling\nto offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers\nand even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate\nas Congress intended and may not operate at all.\n   There is a second reason why, if community rating is\ninvalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion\u2019s\ninvalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner\nconsistent with the Act\u2019s design. A key purpose of an\nexchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options\nwhere prices are standardized regardless of the buy-\ner\u2019s pre-existing conditions. See ibid. An individual who\nshops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate\ndifferent insurance products. The products will offer\ndifferent benefits and prices. Congress designed the ex-\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n            61\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nchanges so the shopper can compare benefits and prices.\nBut the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress\ndesigned if the prices depend on the shopper\u2019s pre-existing\nhealth conditions. The prices would vary from person to\nperson. So without community rating\u2014which prohibits\ninsurers from basing the price of insurance on pre-existing\nconditions\u2014the exchanges cannot operate in the manner\nCongress intended.\n                              d\n          Employer-Responsibility Assessment\n  The employer responsibility assessment provides an\nincentive for employers with at least 50 employees to\nprovide their employees with health insurance options\nthat meet minimum criteria. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a74980H\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV). Unlike the Individual Mandate,\nthe employer-responsibility assessment does not require\nemployers to provide an insurance option. Instead, it re-\nquires them to make a payment to the Federal Govern-\nment if they do not offer insurance to employees and if\ninsurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who\nqualifies for the exchange\u2019s federal subsidies. See ibid.\n  For two reasons, the employer-responsibility assessment\nmust be invalidated. First, the ACA makes a direct link\nbetween the employer-responsibility assessment and the\nexchanges. The financial assessment against employers\noccurs only under certain conditions. One of them is the\npurchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange.\nWith no exchanges, there are no purchases on the ex-\nchanges; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is\nnothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.\n  Second, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals\n(the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regu-\nlations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the\nFederal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges\nand for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reduc-\n62       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                    BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\ntions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employer-\nresponsibility assessment would upset the ACA\u2019s design\nof \u201cshared responsibility.\u201d It would leave employers as the\nonly parties bearing any significant responsibility. That\nwas not the congressional intent.\n                                2\n                The Act\u2019s Minor Provisions\n    The next question is whether the invalidation of the\nACA\u2019s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate\nthe ACA\u2019s other provisions. It does.\n    The ACA is over 900 pages long. Its regulations include\nrequirements ranging from a break time and secluded\nplace at work for nursing mothers, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7207(r)(1)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content\nat chain restaurants, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7343(q)(5)(H).\nThe Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, includ-\ning exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA\n\u00a7\u00a79015, 10906; HCERA \u00a71402, medical devices, see 26\nU. S. C. \u00a74191 (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and tanning booths,\nsee \u00a75000B. It spends government money on, among other\nthings, the study of how to spend less government money.\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71315a. And it includes a number of provisions\nthat provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator.\nFor example, \u00a710323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare\ncoverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in\nLibby, Montana. Another provision, \u00a72006, id., at 284,\nincreases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.\n    Such provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader\u2019s\nstatement, \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t know if there is a senator that doesn\u2019t\nhave something in this bill that was important to them.\n. . . [And] if they don\u2019t have something in it important to\nthem, then it doesn\u2019t speak well of them. That\u2019s what this\nlegislation is all about: It\u2019s the art of compromise.\u2019 \u201d Pear,\nIn Health Bill for Everyone, Provisions for a Few, N. Y.\nTimes, Jan. 4, 2010, p.

So, if the major provision were unconsti-\ntutional, Congress would not have passed the minor one.\n   Without the ACA\u2019s major provisions, many of these\nminor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress\nintended. For example, the tax increases are \u201cRevenue\nOffset Provisions\u201d designed to help offset the cost to the\nFederal Government of programs like the Medicaid Ex-\npansion and the exchanges\u2019 federal subsidies. See Title\nIX, Subtitle A\u2014Revenue Offset Provisions, 124 Stat. 847.\nWith the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invali-\ndated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs,\nand they no longer serve the purpose in the Act\u2019s scheme\nof \u201cshared responsibility\u201d that Congress intended.\n   Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to\ndisplay nutritional content, appear likely to operate as\nCongress intended, but they fail the second test for sever-\nability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would\nhave enacted them independently. The Court has not\npreviously had occasion to consider severability in the con-\ntext of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which in-\ncludes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its\ncentral provisions but also many that are entirely unre-\nlated\u2014hitched on because it was a quick way to get them\npassed despite opposition, or because their proponents\ncould exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their\nneeded support. When we are confronted with such a so-\ncalled \u201cChristmas tree,\u201d a law to which many nongermane\nornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule\nmust be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments\nare superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing\nwhich pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It\nis certain that many of them would not have, and it is not\na proper function of this Court to guess which. To sever\nthe statute in that manner \u201c \u2018would be to make a new law,\nnot to enforce an old one. This is not part of our duty.\u2019 \u201d\n64      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT \n\n                   BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS\n\n       SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\nTrade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S., at 99.\n  This Court must not impose risks unintended by Con-\ngress or produce legislation Congress may have lacked the\nsupport to enact. For those reasons, the unconstitution-\nality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid\nExpansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care\nAct\u2019s other provisions.\n                         *    *     *\n   The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did\nnot write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a\nrequirement with a penalty is instead an option subject\nto a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanc-\ntion of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly\nnoncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the\nAct makes available.\n   The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation\nas judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast\njudicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable\nversion of health-care regulation that Congress did not\nenact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment\nof sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since\nCongress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of\ndeparture a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions\nthat certain interests favored under the Court\u2019s new de-\nsign will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and\nthe States to expend vast sums of money on requirements\nthat may or may not survive the necessary congressional\nrevision.\n   The Court\u2019s disposition, invented and atextual as it is,\ndoes not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional\ndifficulties. It creates them. The holding that the Indi-\nvidual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional\nquestion (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves\nwith inadequate deliberation. And the judgment on the\nMedicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism con-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n            65\n\n        SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting\n\n\ncerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union.\nThose States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must\nsubsidize, by the federal tax dollars taken from their\ncitizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid\nExpansion. If that destabilizing political dynamic, so\nantagonistic to a harmonious Union, is to be introduced at\nall, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.\n   The values that should have determined our course to-\nday are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that\nthe Federal Government is one of limited powers. But\nthe Court\u2019s ruling undermines those values at every turn.\nIn the name of restraint, it overreaches. In the name of\nconstitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional\nquestions. In the name of cooperative federalism, it un-\ndermines state sovereignty.\n   The Constitution, though it dates from the founding of\nthe Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance\nto our own times. The constitutional protections that this\ncase involves are protections of structure. Structural\nprotections\u2014notably, the restraints imposed by federalism\nand separation of powers\u2014are less romantic and have less\nobvious a connection to personal freedom than the provi-\nsions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments.\nHence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by\nour citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to\nteach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers\nconsidered structural protections of freedom the most im-\nportant ones, for which reason they alone were embod-\nied in the original Constitution and not left to later\namendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the\nstructure of our Government is central to liberty, and\nwhen we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today\u2019s\ndecision should have vindicated, should have taught, this\ntruth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.\n   For the reasons here stated, we would find the Act in-\nvalid in its entirety.

The joint dissent and THE CHIEF JUSTICE cor-\nrectly apply our precedents to conclude that the Individual\nMandate is beyond the power granted to Congress un-\nder the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper\nClause. Under those precedents, Congress may regulate\n\u201ceconomic activity [that] substantially affects interstate\ncommerce.\u201d United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 560\n(1995).

S. 1, 67\u201369 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As I have\nexplained, the Court\u2019s continued use of that test \u201chas\nencouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view\nthat the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.\u201d Morri-\nson, supra, at 627. The Government\u2019s unprecedented\nclaim in this suit that it may regulate not only economic\nactivity but also inactivity that substantially affects inter-\nstate commerce is a case in point.\n</pre>",
