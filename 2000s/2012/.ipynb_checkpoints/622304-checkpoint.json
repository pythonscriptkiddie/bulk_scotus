Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                      UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n No. 10\u20131259. Argued November 8, 2011\u2014Decided January 23, 2012\nThe Government obtained a search warrant permitting it to install a\n  Global-Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle regis-\n  tered to respondent Jones\u2019s wife. The warrant authorized installa-\n  tion in the District of Columbia and within 10 days, but agents in-\n  stalled the device on the 11th day and in Maryland. The Government\n  then tracked the vehicle\u2019s movements for 28 days. It subsequently\n  secured an indictment of Jones and others on drug trafficking con-\n  spiracy charges. The District Court suppressed the GPS data ob-\n  tained while the vehicle was parked at Jones\u2019s residence, but held the\n  remaining data admissible because Jones had no reasonable expecta-\n  tion of privacy when the vehicle was on public streets. Jones was\n  convicted. The D. C. Circuit reversed, concluding that admission of\n  the evidence obtained by warrantless use of the GPS device violated\n  the Fourth Amendment.\nHeld: The Government\u2019s attachment of the GPS device to the vehicle,\n and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, consti-\n tutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) The Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the people to be\n secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unrea-\n sonable searches and seizures.\u201d Here, the Government\u2019s physical in-\n trusion on an \u201ceffect\u201d for the purpose of obtaining information consti-\n tutes a \u201csearch.\u201d This type of encroachment on an area enumerated\n in the Amendment would have been considered a search within the\n meaning of the Amendment at the time it was adopted. Pp. 3\u20134.\n    (b) This conclusion is consistent with this Court\u2019s Fourth Amend-\n ment jurisprudence, which until the latter half of the 20th century\n was tied to common-law trespass. Later cases, which have deviated\n from that exclusively property-based approach, have applied the\n2                      UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    analysis of Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in Katz v. United States, 389\n    U. S. 347, which said that the Fourth Amendment protects a person\u2019s\n    \u201creasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d id., at 360. Here, the Court need\n    not address the Government\u2019s contention that Jones had no \u201creason-\n    able expectation of privacy,\u201d because Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment\n    rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom, the\n    Court must \u201cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against\n    government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u201d\n    Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 34. Katz did not repudiate the\n    understanding that the Fourth Amendment embodies a particular\n    concern for government trespass upon the areas it enumerates. The\n    Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, but\n    not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. See Alderman\n    v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 176; Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S.\n    56, 64. United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, and United States v.\n    Karo, 468 U. S. 705\u2014post-Katz cases rejecting Fourth Amendment\n    challenges to \u201cbeepers,\u201d electronic tracking devices representing an-\n    other form of electronic monitoring\u2014do not foreclose the conclusion\n    that a search occurred here. New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, and\n    Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, also do not support the Gov-\n    ernment\u2019s position. Pp. 4\u201312.\n       (c) The Government\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that if the attach-\n    ment and use of the device was a search, it was a reasonable one\u2014is\n    forfeited because it was not raised below.

ANTOINE JONES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                                \n\n                               [January 23, 2012]\n\n                                                 \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   We decide whether the attachment of a Global-\nPositioning-System (GPS) tracking device to an individu-\nal\u2019s vehicle, and subsequent use of that device to monitor\nthe vehicle\u2019s movements on public streets, constitutes a\nsearch or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment.\n                               I\n  In 2004 respondent Antoine Jones, owner and operator\nof a nightclub in the District of Columbia, came under\nsuspicion of trafficking in narcotics and was made the\ntarget of an investigation by a joint FBI and Metropolitan\nPolice Department task force. Officers employed various\ninvestigative techniques, including visual surveillance of\nthe nightclub, installation of a camera focused on the front\ndoor of the club, and a pen register and wiretap covering\nJones\u2019s cellular phone.\n  Based in part on information gathered from these\nsources, in 2005 the Government applied to the United\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia for a\nwarrant authorizing the use of an electronic tracking\ndevice on the Jeep Grand Cherokee registered to Jones\u2019s\n2                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwife. A warrant issued, authorizing installation of the de-\nvice in the District of Columbia and within 10 days.\n   On the 11th day, and not in the District of Columbia but\nin Maryland,1 agents installed a GPS tracking device on\nthe undercarriage of the Jeep while it was parked in a\npublic parking lot. Over the next 28 days, the Govern-\nment used the device to track the vehicle\u2019s movements,\nand once had to replace the device\u2019s battery when the\nvehicle was parked in a different public lot in Maryland.\nBy means of signals from multiple satellites, the device\nestablished the vehicle\u2019s location within 50 to 100 feet, and\ncommunicated that location by cellular phone to a Gov-\nernment computer. It relayed more than 2,000 pages of\ndata over the 4-week period.\n   The Government ultimately obtained a multiple-count\nindictment charging Jones and several alleged co-\nconspirators with, as relevant here, conspiracy to distrib-\nute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or\nmore of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in\nviolation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841 and 846. Before trial, Jones\nfiled a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the\nGPS device. The District Court granted the motion only in\npart, suppressing the data obtained while the vehicle was\nparked in the garage adjoining Jones\u2019s residence. 451\nF. Supp. 2d 71, 88 (2006). It held the remaining data\nadmissible, because \u201c \u2018[a] person traveling in an automo-\nbile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation\nof privacy in his movements from one place to another.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 281\n(1983)). Jones\u2019s trial in October 2006 produced a hung\njury on the conspiracy count.\n   In March 2007, a grand jury returned another indict-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In this litigation, the Government has conceded noncompliance with\n\nthe warrant and has argued only that a warrant was not required.\nUnited States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544, 566, n. (CADC 2010).\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nment, charging Jones and others with the same conspir-\nacy. The Government introduced at trial the same GPS-\nderived locational data admitted in the first trial, which\nconnected Jones to the alleged conspirators\u2019 stash house\nthat contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of cocaine,\nand 1 kilogram of cocaine base. The jury returned a guilty\nverdict, and the District Court sentenced Jones to life\nimprisonment.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit reversed the conviction because of ad-\nmission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of\nthe GPS device which, it said, violated the Fourth Amend-\nment. United States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544 (2010).\nThe D. C. Circuit denied the Government\u2019s petition for\nrehearing en banc, with four judges dissenting. 625 F. 3d\n766 (2010). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n                             II\n\n                               \n\n                             A\n\n   The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that\n\u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d It is beyond dispute\nthat a vehicle is an \u201ceffect\u201d as that term is used in the\nAmendment. United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 12\n(1977). We hold that the Government\u2019s installation of a\nGPS device on a target\u2019s vehicle,2 and its use of that device\nto monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, constitutes a \u201csearch.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 As we have noted, the Jeep was registered to Jones\u2019s wife. The Gov-\nernment acknowledged, however, that Jones was \u201cthe exclusive driver.\u201d\nId., at 555, n. (internal quotation marks omitted). If Jones was not the\nowner he had at least the property rights of a bailee. The Court of\nAppeals concluded that the vehicle\u2019s registration did not affect his\nability to make a Fourth Amendment objection, ibid., and the Govern-\nment has not challenged that determination here. We therefore do not\nconsider the Fourth Amendment significance of Jones\u2019s status.\n4                UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  It is important to be clear about what occurred in this\ncase: The Government physically occupied private proper-\nty for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no\ndoubt that such a physical intrusion would have been\nconsidered a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment when it was adopted. Entick v. Carrington,\n95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C. P. 1765), is a \u201ccase we have described\nas a \u2018monument of English freedom\u2019 \u2018undoubtedly familiar\u2019\nto \u2018every American statesman\u2019 at the time the Constitution\nwas adopted, and considered to be \u2018the true and ultimate\nexpression of constitutional law\u2019 \u201d with regard to search\nand seizure. Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 596\n(1989) (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626\n(1886)). In that case, Lord Camden expressed in plain\nterms the significance of property rights in search-and-\nseizure analysis:\n    \u201c[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred,\n    that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour\u2019s close\n    without his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though\n    he does no damage at all; if he will tread upon his\n    neighbour\u2019s ground, he must justify it by law.\u201d Entick,\n    supra, at 817.\nThe text of the Fourth Amendment reflects its close con-\nnection to property, since otherwise it would have referred\nsimply to \u201cthe right of the people to be secure against\nunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d; the phrase \u201cin their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d would have been\nsuperfluous.\n  Consistent with this understanding, our Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law tres-\npass, at least until the latter half of the 20th century.\nKyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001); Kerr, The\nFourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional\nMyths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801,\n816 (2004). Thus, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S.\n                     Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n438 (1928), we held that wiretaps attached to telephone\nwires on the public streets did not constitute a Fourth\nAmendment search because \u201c[t]here was no entry of the\nhouses or offices of the defendants,\u201d id., at 464.\n   Our later cases, of course, have deviated from that\nexclusively property-based approach. In Katz v. United\nStates, 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967), we said that \u201cthe Fourth\nAmendment protects people, not places,\u201d and found a\nviolation in attachment of an eavesdropping device to a\npublic telephone booth. Our later cases have applied the\nanalysis of Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in that case,\nwhich said that a violation occurs when government offic-\ners violate a person\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d\nid., at 360. See, e.g., Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334\n(2000); California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207 (1986); Smith\nv. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979).\n   The Government contends that the Harlan standard\nshows that no search occurred here, since Jones had no\n\u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in the area of the Jeep\naccessed by Government agents (its underbody) and in the\nlocations of the Jeep on the public roads, which were\nvisible to all. But we need not address the Government\u2019s\ncontentions, because Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights\ndo not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom,\nwe must \u201cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy\nagainst government that existed when the Fourth\nAmendment was adopted.\u201d Kyllo, supra, at 34. As ex-\nplained, for most of our history the Fourth Amendment\nwas understood to embody a particular concern for gov-\nernment trespass upon the areas (\u201cpersons, houses, pa-\npers, and effects\u201d) it enumerates.3 Katz did not repudiate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence (hereinafter concurrence) doubts the\n\nwisdom of our approach because \u201cit is almost impossible to think of\nlate-18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in\nthis case.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). But in fact it\nposits a situation that is not far afield\u2014a constable\u2019s concealing himself\n6                    UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat understanding. Less than two years later the Court\nupheld defendants\u2019 contention that the Government could\nnot introduce against them conversations between other\npeople obtained by warrantless placement of electronic\nsurveillance devices in their homes. The opinion rejected\nthe dissent\u2019s contention that there was no Fourth\nAmendment violation \u201cunless the conversational privacy of\nthe homeowner himself is invaded.\u201d4 Alderman v. United\nStates, 394 U. S. 165, 176 (1969). \u201c[W]e [do not] believe\nthat Katz, by holding that the Fourth Amendment protects\npersons and their private conversations, was intended\nto withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment\nextends to the home . . . .\u201d Id., at 180.\n  More recently, in Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56\n(1992), the Court unanimously rejected the argument that\nalthough a \u201cseizure\u201d had occurred \u201cin a \u2018technical\u2019 sense\u201d\nwhen a trailer home was forcibly removed, id., at 62, no\nFourth Amendment violation occurred because law en-\nforcement had not \u201cinvade[d] the [individuals\u2019] privacy,\u201d\nid., at 60. Katz, the Court explained, established that\n\u201cproperty rights are not the sole measure of Fourth\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nin the target\u2019s coach in order to track its movements. Ibid. There is no\ndoubt that the information gained by that trespassory activity would be\nthe product of an unlawful search\u2014whether that information consisted\nof the conversations occurring in the coach, or of the destinations to\nwhich the coach traveled.\n   In any case, it is quite irrelevant whether there was an 18th-century\nanalog. Whatever new methods of investigation may be devised, our\ntask, at a minimum, is to decide whether the action in question would\nhave constituted a \u201csearch\u201d within the original meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment. Where, as here, the Government obtains information by\nphysically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search\nhas undoubtedly occurred.\n   4 Thus, the concurrence\u2019s attempt to recast Alderman as meaning that\n\nindividuals have a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy in all conversa-\ntions that [take] place under their roof,\u201d post, at 6\u20137, is foreclosed by\nthe Court\u2019s opinion. The Court took as a given that the homeowner\u2019s\n\u201cconversational privacy\u201d had not been violated.\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment violations,\u201d but did not \u201csnuf[f ] out the previ-\nously recognized protection for property.\u201d 506 U. S., at 64.\nAs Justice Brennan explained in his concurrence in\nKnotts, Katz did not erode the principle \u201cthat, when the\nGovernment does engage in physical intrusion of a consti-\ntutionally protected area in order to obtain information,\nthat intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201d 460 U. S., at 286 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). We have embodied that preservation of past\nrights in our very definition of \u201creasonable expectation\nof privacy\u201d which we have said to be an expectation \u201cthat\nhas a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by\nreference to concepts of real or personal property law or\nto understandings that are recognized and permitted by\nsociety.\u201d Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 88 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Katz did not narrow\nthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s scope.5\n   The Government contends that several of our post-Katz\ncases foreclose the conclusion that what occurred here\nconstituted a search. It relies principally on two cases in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  concurrence notes that post-Katz we have explained that \u201c \u2018an\nactual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a consti-\ntutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6 (quoting United States v. Karo, 468 U. S.\n705, 713 (1984)). That is undoubtedly true, and undoubtedly irrele-\nvant. Karo was considering whether a seizure occurred, and as the\nconcurrence explains, a seizure of property occurs, not when there is a\ntrespass, but \u201cwhen there is some meaningful interference with an\nindividual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u201d Post, at 2 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Likewise with a search. Trespass alone\ndoes not qualify, but there must be conjoined with that what was\npresent here: an attempt to find something or to obtain information.\n   Related to this, and similarly irrelevant, is the concurrence\u2019s point\nthat, if analyzed separately, neither the installation of the device nor\nits use would constitute a Fourth Amendment search. See ibid. Of\ncourse not. A trespass on \u201chouses\u201d or \u201ceffects,\u201d or a Katz invasion of\nprivacy, is not alone a search unless it is done to obtain information;\nand the obtaining of information is not alone a search unless it is\nachieved by such a trespass or invasion of privacy.\n8                    UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich we rejected Fourth Amendment challenges to\n\u201cbeepers,\u201d electronic tracking devices that represent an-\nother form of electronic monitoring. The first case, Knotts,\nupheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the use of a\n\u201cbeeper\u201d that had been placed in a container of chloroform,\nallowing law enforcement to monitor the location of the\ncontainer. 460 U. S., at 278. We said that there had been\nno infringement of Knotts\u2019 reasonable expectation of pri-\nvacy since the information obtained\u2014the location of the\nautomobile carrying the container on public roads, and\nthe location of the off-loaded container in open fields near\nKnotts\u2019 cabin\u2014had been voluntarily conveyed to the pub-\nlic.6 Id., at 281\u2013282. But as we have discussed, the Katz\nreasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to,\nnot substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. The\nholding in Knotts addressed only the former, since the\nlatter was not at issue. The beeper had been placed in\nthe container before it came into Knotts\u2019 possession, with\nthe consent of the then-owner. 460 U. S., at 278. Knotts\ndid not challenge that installation, and we specifically de-\nclined to consider its effect on the Fourth Amendment\nanalysis. Id., at 279, n. Knotts would be relevant, per-\nhaps, if the Government were making the argument that\nwhat would otherwise be an unconstitutional search is\nnot such where it produces only public information. The\nGovernment does not make that argument, and we know\nof no case that would support it.\n   The second \u201cbeeper\u201d case, United States v. Karo, 468\nU. S. 705 (1984), does not suggest a different conclusion.\nThere we addressed the question left open by Knotts,\nwhether the installation of a beeper in a container\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Knotts noted the \u201climited use which the government made of the\n\nsignals from this particular beeper,\u201d 460 U. S., at 284; and reserved the\nquestion whether \u201cdifferent constitutional principles may be applicable\u201d\nto \u201cdragnet-type law enforcement practices\u201d of the type that GPS\ntracking made possible here, ibid.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\namounted to a search or seizure. 468 U. S., at 713. As in\nKnotts, at the time the beeper was installed the container\nbelonged to a third party, and it did not come into posses-\nsion of the defendant until later. 468 U. S., at 708. Thus,\nthe specific question we considered was whether the in-\nstallation \u201cwith the consent of the original owner consti-\ntute[d] a search or seizure . . . when the container is deliv-\nered to a buyer having no knowledge of the presence of the\nbeeper.\u201d Id., at 707 (emphasis added). We held not. The\nGovernment, we said, came into physical contact with\nthe container only before it belonged to the defendant Karo;\nand the transfer of the container with the unmonitored\nbeeper inside did not convey any information and thus did\nnot invade Karo\u2019s privacy. See id., at 712. That conclu-\nsion is perfectly consistent with the one we reach here.\nKaro accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and\nall, and was therefore not entitled to object to the beeper\u2019s\npresence, even though it was used to monitor the contain-\ner\u2019s location. Cf. On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747,\n751\u2013752 (1952) (no search or seizure where an informant,\nwho was wearing a concealed microphone, was invited into\nthe defendant\u2019s business). Jones, who possessed the Jeep\nat the time the Government trespassorily inserted the\ninformation-gathering device, is on much different footing.\n   The Government also points to our exposition in New\nYork v. Class, 475 U. S. 106 (1986), that \u201c[t]he exterior of\na car . . . is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine\nit does not constitute a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 114. That state-\nment is of marginal relevance here since, as the Govern-\nment acknowledges, \u201cthe officers in this case did more\nthan conduct a visual inspection of respondent\u2019s vehicle,\u201d\nBrief for United States 41 (emphasis added). By attaching\nthe device to the Jeep, officers encroached on a protected\narea. In Class itself we suggested that this would make a\ndifference, for we concluded that an officer\u2019s momentary\nreaching into the interior of a vehicle did constitute a\n10                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsearch.7 475 U. S., at 114\u2013115.\n   Finally, the Government\u2019s position gains little support\nfrom our conclusion in Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S.\n170 (1984), that officers\u2019 information-gathering intrusion\non an \u201copen field\u201d did not constitute a Fourth Amendment\nsearch even though it was a trespass at common law, id.,\nat 183. Quite simply, an open field, unlike the curtilage of\na home, see United States v. Dunn, 480 U. S. 294, 300\n(1987), is not one of those protected areas enumerated in\nthe Fourth Amendment. Oliver, supra, at 176\u2013177. See\nalso Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 59 (1924). The\nGovernment\u2019s physical intrusion on such an area\u2014unlike\nits intrusion on the \u201ceffect\u201d at issue here\u2014is of no Fourth\nAmendment significance.8\n                           B\n  The concurrence begins by accusing us of applying\n\u201c18th-century tort law.\u201d Post, at 1. That is a distortion.\nWhat we apply is an 18th-century guarantee against un-\nreasonable searches, which we believe must provide at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  Government also points to Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583\n(1974), in which the Court rejected the claim that the inspection of an\nimpounded vehicle\u2019s tire tread and the collection of paint scrapings\nfrom its exterior violated the Fourth Amendment. Whether the plural-\nity said so because no search occurred or because the search was rea-\nsonable is unclear. Compare id., at 591 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)\n(\u201c[W]e fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed\u201d),\nwith id., at 592 (\u201cUnder circumstances such as these, where probable\ncause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not\nunreasonable . . . \u201d).\n   8 Thus, our theory is not that the Fourth Amendment is concerned\n\nwith \u201cany technical trespass that led to the gathering of evidence.\u201d\nPost, at 3 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis added). The\nFourth Amendment protects against trespassory searches only with\nregard to those items (\u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d) that it\nenumerates. The trespass that occurred in Oliver may properly be\nunderstood as a \u201csearch,\u201d but not one \u201cin the constitutional sense.\u201d 466\nU. S., at 170, 183.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na minimum the degree of protection it afforded when it\nwas adopted. The concurrence does not share that belief.\nIt would apply exclusively Katz\u2019s reasonable-expectation-\nof-privacy test, even when that eliminates rights that\npreviously existed.\n   The concurrence faults our approach for \u201cpresent[ing]\nparticularly vexing problems\u201d in cases that do not involve\nphysical contact, such as those that involve the transmis-\nsion of electronic signals. Post, at 9. We entirely fail to\nunderstand that point. For unlike the concurrence, which\nwould make Katz the exclusive test, we do not make tres-\npass the exclusive test. Situations involving merely the\ntransmission of electronic signals without trespass would\nremain subject to Katz analysis.\n   In fact, it is the concurrence\u2019s insistence on the exclusiv-\nity of the Katz test that needlessly leads us into \u201cparticu-\nlarly vexing problems\u201d in the present case. This Court has\nto date not deviated from the understanding that mere\nvisual observation does not constitute a search. See Kyllo,\n533 U. S., at 31\u201332. We accordingly held in Knotts that\n\u201c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thorough-\nfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his\nmovements from one place to another.\u201d 460 U. S., at 281.\nThus, even assuming that the concurrence is correct to\nsay that \u201c[t]raditional surveillance\u201d of Jones for a 4-week\nperiod \u201cwould have required a large team of agents, multi-\nple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance,\u201d post, at 12,\nour cases suggest that such visual observation is constitu-\ntionally permissible. It may be that achieving the same\nresult through electronic means, without an accompany-\ning trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy,\nbut the present case does not require us to answer that\nquestion.\n   And answering it affirmatively leads us needlessly into\nadditional thorny problems. The concurrence posits that\n\u201crelatively short-term monitoring of a person\u2019s movements\n12               UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non public streets\u201d is okay, but that \u201cthe use of longer term\nGPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses\u201d is no\ngood. Post, at 13 (emphasis added). That introduces yet\nanother novelty into our jurisprudence. There is no prece-\ndent for the proposition that whether a search has oc-\ncurred depends on the nature of the crime being investi-\ngated. And even accepting that novelty, it remains\nunexplained why a 4-week investigation is \u201csurely\u201d too\nlong and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy involving sub-\nstantial amounts of cash and narcotics is not an \u201cextra-\nordinary offens[e]\u201d which may permit longer observation.\nSee post, at 13\u201314. What of a 2-day monitoring of a\nsuspected purveyor of stolen electronics? Or of a 6-month\nmonitoring of a suspected terrorist? We may have to\ngrapple with these \u201cvexing problems\u201d in some future case\nwhere a classic trespassory search is not involved and\nresort must be had to Katz analysis; but there is no reason\nfor rushing forward to resolve them here.\n                             III\n  The Government argues in the alternative that even if\nthe attachment and use of the device was a search, it was\nreasonable\u2014and thus lawful\u2014under the Fourth Amend-\nment because \u201cofficers had reasonable suspicion, and in-\ndeed probable cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader\nin a large-scale cocaine distribution conspiracy.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 50\u201351. We have no occasion to consider this\nargument. The Government did not raise it below, and\nthe D. C. Circuit therefore did not address it. See 625\nF. 3d, at 767 (Ginsburg, Tatel, and Griffith, JJ., concur-\nring in denial of rehearing en banc). We consider the\nargument forfeited. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537\nU.

In this case, the Gov-\nernment installed a Global Positioning System (GPS)\ntracking device on respondent Antoine Jones\u2019 Jeep without\na valid warrant and without Jones\u2019 consent, then used\nthat device to monitor the Jeep\u2019s movements over the\ncourse of four weeks. The Government usurped Jones\u2019\nproperty for the purpose of conducting surveillance on\nhim, thereby invading privacy interests long afforded, and\nundoubtedly entitled to, Fourth Amendment protection.\nSee, e.g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511\u2013\n512 (1961).\n   Of course, the Fourth Amendment is not concerned only\nwith trespassory intrusions on property. See, e.g., Kyllo v.\nUnited States, 533 U. S. 27, 31\u201333 (2001). Rather, even in\nthe absence of a trespass, \u201ca Fourth Amendment search\noccurs when the government violates a subjective expecta-\ntion of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.\u201d Id.,\nat 33; see also Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741\n(1979); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361 (1967)\n(Harlan, J., concurring). In Katz, this Court enlarged its\nthen-prevailing focus on property rights by announcing\n2                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthat the reach of the Fourth Amendment does not \u201cturn\nupon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion.\u201d Id.,\nat 353. As the majority\u2019s opinion makes clear, however,\nKatz\u2019s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test augmented,\nbut did not displace or diminish, the common-law trespas-\nsory test that preceded it. Ante, at 8. Thus, \u201cwhen the\nGovernment does engage in physical intrusion of a consti-\ntutionally protected area in order to obtain information,\nthat intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201d United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286\n(1983) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); see also, e.g.,\nRakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 144, n. 12 (1978). JUSTICE\nALITO\u2019s approach, which discounts altogether the constitu-\ntional relevance of the Government\u2019s physical intrusion on\nJones\u2019 Jeep, erodes that longstanding protection for priva-\ncy expectations inherent in items of property that people\npossess or control. See post, at 5\u20137 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). By contrast, the trespassory test applied in\nthe majority\u2019s opinion reflects an irreducible constitutional\nminimum: When the Government physically invades\npersonal property to gather information, a search occurs.\nThe reaffirmation of that principle suffices to decide this\ncase.\n   Nonetheless, as JUSTICE ALITO notes, physical intrusion\nis now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance. Post, at\n9\u201312. With increasing regularity, the Government will be\ncapable of duplicating the monitoring undertaken in this\ncase by enlisting factory- or owner-installed vehicle track-\ning devices or GPS-enabled smartphones. See United\nStates v. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d 1120, 1125 (CA9 2010)\n(Kozinski, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc). In cases of electronic or other novel modes of sur-\nveillance that do not depend upon a physical invasion\non property, the majority opinion\u2019s trespassory test may\nprovide little guidance. But \u201c[s]ituations involving merely\nthe transmission of electronic signals without trespass\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nwould remain subject to Katz analysis.\u201d Ante, at 11. As\nJUSTICE ALITO incisively observes, the same technological\nadvances that have made possible nontrespassory surveil-\nlance techniques will also affect the Katz test by shaping\nthe evolution of societal privacy expectations. Post, at\n10\u201311. Under that rubric, I agree with JUSTICE ALITO that,\nat the very least, \u201clonger term GPS monitoring in inves-\ntigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of\nprivacy.\u201d Post, at 13.\n   In cases involving even short-term monitoring, some\nunique attributes of GPS surveillance relevant to the Katz\nanalysis will require particular attention. GPS monitoring\ngenerates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\u2019s\npublic movements that reflects a wealth of detail about\nher familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual\nassociations. See, e.g., People v. Weaver, 12 N. Y. 3d 433,\n441\u2013442, 909 N. E. 2d 1195, 1199 (2009) (\u201cDisclosed in\n[GPS] data . . . will be trips the indisputably private na-\nture of which takes little imagination to conjure: trips\nto the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic,\nthe AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal\ndefense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meet-\ning, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and\non and on\u201d). The Government can store such records\nand efficiently mine them for information years into the\nfuture. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d, at 1124 (opinion of\nKozinski, C. J.). And because GPS monitoring is cheap\nin comparison to conventional surveillance techniques and,\nby design, proceeds surreptitiously, it evades the ordinary\nchecks that constrain abusive law enforcement practices:\n\u201climited police resources and community hostility.\u201d Illi-\nnois v. Lidster, 540 U. S. 419, 426 (2004).\n   Awareness that the Government may be watching chills\nassociational and expressive freedoms. And the Govern-\nment\u2019s unrestrained power to assemble data that reveal\nprivate aspects of identity is susceptible to abuse. The net\n4                     UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nresult is that GPS monitoring\u2014by making available at a\nrelatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate\ninformation about any person whom the Government, in\nits unfettered discretion, chooses to track\u2014may \u201calter the\nrelationship between citizen and government in a way\nthat is inimical to democratic society.\u201d United States v.\nCuevas-Perez, 640 F. 3d 272, 285 (CA7 2011) (Flaum, J.,\nconcurring).\n   I would take these attributes of GPS monitoring into\naccount when considering the existence of a reasonable\nsocietal expectation of privacy in the sum of one\u2019s public\nmovements. I would ask whether people reasonably ex-\npect that their movements will be recorded and aggregat-\ned in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain,\nmore or less at will, their political and religious beliefs,\nsexual habits, and so on. I do not regard as dispositive\nthe fact that the Government might obtain the fruits of\nGPS monitoring through lawful conventional surveillance\ntechniques. See Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 35, n. 2; ante, at 11\n(leaving open the possibility that duplicating traditional\nsurveillance \u201cthrough electronic means, without an ac-\ncompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of\nprivacy\u201d). I would also consider the appropriateness of\nentrusting to the Executive, in the absence of any over-\nsight from a coordinate branch, a tool so amenable to\nmisuse, especially in light of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s goal\nto curb arbitrary exercises of police power to and prevent\n\u201ca too permeating police surveillance,\u201d United States v.\nDi Re, 332 U.

As the majority\u2019s opinion notes, Knotts\nreserved the question whether \u201c \u2018different constitutional principles\nmay be applicable\u2019 \u201d to invasive law enforcement practices such as GPS\ntracking. See ante, at 8, n. 6 (quoting 460 U. S., at 284).\n   United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705 (1984), addressed the Fourth\n                     Cite as: 565 U.

E.g., Smith, 442 U. S., at 742; United States v.\nMiller, 425 U. S. 435, 443 (1976). This approach is ill\nsuited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great\ndeal of information about themselves to third parties in\nthe course of carrying out mundane tasks. People disclose\nthe phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellu-\nlar providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail\naddresses with which they correspond to their Internet\nservice providers; and the books, groceries, and medi-\ncations they purchase to online retailers. Perhaps, as\nJUSTICE ALITO notes, some people may find the \u201ctradeoff \u201d\nof privacy for convenience \u201cworthwhile,\u201d or come to accept\nthis \u201cdiminution of privacy\u201d as \u201cinevitable,\u201d post, at 10,\nand perhaps not. I for one doubt that people would accept\nwithout complaint the warrantless disclosure to the Gov-\nernment of a list of every Web site they had visited in the\nlast week, or month, or year. But whatever the societal\nexpectations, they can attain constitutionally protected\nstatus only if our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence ceases\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAmendment implications of the installation of a beeper in a container\nwith the consent of the container\u2019s original owner, who was aware\nthat the beeper would be used for surveillance purposes.

In addition, the bugged container in Karo lacked\nthe close relationship with the target that a car shares with its owner.\nThe bugged container in Karo was stationary for much of the Govern-\nment\u2019s surveillance. See 468 U. S., at 708\u2013710. A car\u2019s movements, by\ncontrast, are its owner\u2019s movements.\n6                UNITED STATES v.

Ironically, the Court\nhas chosen to decide this case based on 18th-century\ntort law. By attaching a small GPS device1 to the under-\nside of the vehicle that respondent drove, the law enforce-\nment officers in this case engaged in conduct that might\nhave provided grounds in 1791 for a suit for trespass\nto chattels.2 And for this reason, the Court concludes,\nthe installation and use of the GPS device constituted\na search.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n  2 At common law, a suit for trespass to chattels could be maintained if\n\nthere was a violation of \u201cthe dignitary interest in the inviolability of\nchattels,\u201d but today there must be \u201csome actual damage to the chattel\nbefore the action can be maintained.\u201d W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton,\n& D. Owen, Prosser & Keeton on Law of Torts 87 (5th ed. 1984) (here-\ninafter Prosser & Keeton). Here, there was no actual damage to the\nvehicle to which the GPS device was attached.\n2                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  This holding, in my judgment, is unwise. It strains the\nlanguage of the Fourth Amendment; it has little if any\nsupport in current Fourth Amendment case law; and it is\nhighly artificial.\n  I would analyze the question presented in this case by\nasking whether respondent\u2019s reasonable expectations of\nprivacy were violated by the long-term monitoring of the\nmovements of the vehicle he drove.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable\nsearches and seizures,\u201d and the Court makes very little\neffort to explain how the attachment or use of the GPS\ndevice fits within these terms. The Court does not contend\nthat there was a seizure. A seizure of property occurs\nwhen there is \u201csome meaningful interference with an in-\ndividual\u2019s possessory interests in that property,\u201d United\nStates v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109, 113 (1984), and here\nthere was none. Indeed, the success of the surveillance\ntechnique that the officers employed was dependent on\nthe fact that the GPS did not interfere in any way with\nthe operation of the vehicle, for if any such interference had\nbeen detected, the device might have been discovered.\n  The Court does claim that the installation and use of the\nGPS constituted a search, see ante, at 3\u20134, but this con-\nclusion is dependent on the questionable proposition that\nthese two procedures cannot be separated for purposes of\nFourth Amendment analysis. If these two procedures are\nanalyzed separately, it is not at all clear from the Court\u2019s\nopinion why either should be regarded as a search. It is\nclear that the attachment of the GPS device was not itself\na search; if the device had not functioned or if the officers\nhad not used it, no information would have been obtained.\nAnd the Court does not contend that the use of the device\nconstituted a search either. On the contrary, the Court\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\naccepts the holding in United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S.\n276 (1983), that the use of a surreptitiously planted elec-\ntronic device to monitor a vehicle\u2019s movements on public\nroads did not amount to a search. See ante, at 7.\n   The Court argues\u2014and I agree\u2014that \u201cwe must \u2018assur[e]\npreservation of that degree of privacy against government\nthat existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 5 (quoting Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27,\n34 (2001)). But it is almost impossible to think of late-\n18th-century situations that are analogous to what took\nplace in this case. (Is it possible to imagine a case in\nwhich a constable secreted himself somewhere in a coach\nand remained there for a period of time in order to monitor\nthe movements of the coach\u2019s owner?3) The Court\u2019s theory\nseems to be that the concept of a search, as originally un-\nderstood, comprehended any technical trespass that led\nto the gathering of evidence, but we know that this is in-\ncorrect. At common law, any unauthorized intrusion on\nprivate property was actionable, see Prosser & Keeton 75,\nbut a trespass on open fields, as opposed to the \u201ccurtilage\u201d\nof a home, does not fall within the scope of the Fourth\nAmendment because private property outside the curtilage\nis not part of a \u201chous[e]\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment. See Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170\n(1984); Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924).\n                            B\n  The Court\u2019s reasoning in this case is very similar to that\nin the Court\u2019s early decisions involving wiretapping and\nelectronic eavesdropping, namely, that a technical tres-\npass followed by the gathering of evidence constitutes a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3The Court suggests that something like this might have occurred in\n1791, but this would have required either a gigantic coach, a very tiny\nconstable, or both\u2014not to mention a constable with incredible fortitude\nand patience.\n4                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsearch. In the early electronic surveillance cases, the\nCourt concluded that a Fourth Amendment search oc-\ncurred when private conversations were monitored as a\nresult of an \u201cunauthorized physical penetration into the\npremises occupied\u201d by the defendant. Silverman v. United\nStates, 365 U. S. 505, 509 (1961). In Silverman, police\nofficers listened to conversations in an attached home by\ninserting a \u201cspike mike\u201d through the wall that this house\nshared with the vacant house next door. Id., at 506. This\nprocedure was held to be a search because the mike made\ncontact with a heating duct on the other side of the wall\nand thus \u201cusurp[ed] . . . an integral part of the premises.\u201d\nId., at 511.\n  By contrast, in cases in which there was no trespass, it\nwas held that there was no search. Thus, in Olmstead v.\nUnited States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), the Court found that\nthe Fourth Amendment did not apply because \u201c[t]he taps\nfrom house lines were made in the streets near the\nhouses.\u201d Id., at 457. Similarly, the Court concluded that no\nsearch occurred in Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S.\n129, 135 (1942), where a \u201cdetectaphone\u201d was placed on the\nouter wall of defendant\u2019s office for the purpose of overhear-\ning conversations held within the room.\n  This trespass-based rule was repeatedly criticized. In\nOlmstead, Justice Brandeis wrote that it was \u201cimmaterial\nwhere the physical connection with the telephone wires\nwas made.\u201d 277 U. S., at 479 (dissenting opinion). Al-\nthough a private conversation transmitted by wire did not\nfall within the literal words of the Fourth Amendment, he\nargued, the Amendment should be understood as prohibit-\ning \u201cevery unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon\nthe privacy of the individual.\u201d Id., at 478. See also, e.g.,\nSilverman, supra, at 513 (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201cThe\nconcept of \u2018an unauthorized physical penetration into the\npremises,\u2019 on which the present decision rests seems to me\nbeside the point.

United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), finally did\naway with the old approach, holding that a trespass was\nnot required for a Fourth Amendment violation. Katz in-\nvolved the use of a listening device that was attached to\nthe outside of a public telephone booth and that allowed\npolice officers to eavesdrop on one end of the target\u2019s\nphone conversation. This procedure did not physically\nintrude on the area occupied by the target, but the Katz\nCourt \u201crepudiate[ed]\u201d the old doctrine, Rakas v. Illinois,\n439 U. S. 128, 143 (1978), and held that \u201c[t]he fact that the\nelectronic device employed . . . did not happen to penetrate\nthe wall of the booth can have no constitutional signifi-\ncance,\u201d 389 U. S., at 353 (\u201c[T]he reach of th[e] [Fourth]\nAmendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a\nphysical intrusion into any given enclosure\u201d); see Rakas,\nsupra, at 143 (describing Katz as holding that the \u201cca-\npacity to claim the protection for the Fourth Amendment\ndepends not upon a property right in the invaded place but\nupon whether the person who claims the protection of the\nAmendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the\ninvaded place\u201d); Kyllo, supra, at 32 (\u201cWe have since decou-\npled violation of a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights\nfrom trespassory violation of his property\u201d). What mattered,\nthe Court now held, was whether the conduct at issue\n\u201cviolated the privacy upon which [the defendant] justifi-\nably relied while using the telephone booth.\u201d Katz, supra,\n6                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 353.\n  Under this approach, as the Court later put it when\naddressing the relevance of a technical trespass, \u201can actu-\nal trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish\na constitutional violation.\u201d United States v. Karo, 468\nU. S. 705, 713 (1984) (emphasis added). Ibid. (\u201cCom-\npar[ing] Katz v. United States, 389 U.

In Oliver, the Court\nwrote:\n    \u201cThe existence of a property right is but one element\n    in determining whether expectations of privacy are\n    legitimate. \u2018The premise that property interests con-\n    trol the right of the Government to search and seize\n    has been discredited.\u2019 Katz, 389 U. S., at 353, (quot-\n    ing Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304 (1967);\n    some internal quotation marks omitted).\u201d 466 U. S.,\n    at 183.\n                              II\n  The majority suggests that two post-Katz decisions\u2014\nSoldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56 (1992), and Alderman\nv. United States, 394 U. S. 165 (1969)\u2014show that a tech-\nnical trespass is sufficient to establish the existence of a\nsearch, but they provide little support.\n  In Soldal, the Court held that towing away a trailer\nhome without the owner\u2019s consent constituted a seizure\neven if this did not invade the occupants\u2019 personal privacy.\nBut in the present case, the Court does not find that there\nwas a seizure, and it is clear that none occurred.\n  In Alderman, the Court held that the Fourth Amend-\nment rights of homeowners were implicated by the use of a\nsurreptitiously planted listening device to monitor third-\nparty conversations that occurred within their home. See\n394 U. S., at 176\u2013180. Alderman is best understood to\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

See Rakas, 439 U. S., at 144, n. 12 (citing Alderman\nfor the proposition that \u201cthe Court has not altogether\nabandoned use of property concepts in determining the\npresence or absence of the privacy interests protected by\nthat Amendment\u201d); 439 U. S., at 153 (Powell, J., concur-\nring) (citing Alderman for the proposition that \u201cproperty\nrights reflect society\u2019s explicit recognition of a person\u2019s au-\nthority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and there-\nfore should be considered in determining whether an\nindividual\u2019s expectations of privacy are reasonable); Karo,\nsupra, at 732 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part) (citing Alderman in support of the proposition\nthat \u201ca homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy\nin the contents of his home, including items owned by\nothers\u201d).\n  In sum, the majority is hard pressed to find support in\npost-Katz cases for its trespass-based theory.\n                               III\n   Disharmony with a substantial body of existing case law\nis only one of the problems with the Court\u2019s approach in\nthis case.\n   I will briefly note four others. First, the Court\u2019s reason-\ning largely disregards what is really important (the use of\na GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking) and instead\nattaches great significance to something that most would\nview as relatively minor (attaching to the bottom of a car a\nsmall, light object that does not interfere in any way with\nthe car\u2019s operation). Attaching such an object is generally\nregarded as so trivial that it does not provide a basis for\nrecovery under modern tort law. See Prosser & Keeton\n\u00a714, at 87 (harmless or trivial contact with personal prop-\nerty not actionable); D. Dobbs, Law of Torts 124 (2000)\n(same). But under the Court\u2019s reasoning, this conduct\n8                         UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                        ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmay violate the Fourth Amendment. By contrast, if long-\nterm monitoring can be accomplished without committing\na technical trespass\u2014suppose, for example, that the Fed-\neral Government required or persuaded auto manufactur-\ners to include a GPS tracking device in every car\u2014the\nCourt\u2019s theory would provide no protection.\n  Second, the Court\u2019s approach leads to incongruous\nresults. If the police attach a GPS device to a car and use\nthe device to follow the car for even a brief time, under the\nCourt\u2019s theory, the Fourth Amendment applies. But if the\npolice follow the same car for a much longer period using\nunmarked cars and aerial assistance, this tracking is not\nsubject to any Fourth Amendment constraints.\n  In the present case, the Fourth Amendment applies, the\nCourt concludes, because the officers installed the GPS\ndevice after respondent\u2019s wife, to whom the car was regis-\ntered, turned it over to respondent for his exclusive use.\nSee ante, at 8. But if the GPS had been attached prior to\nthat time, the Court\u2019s theory would lead to a different\nresult. The Court proceeds on the assumption that re-\nspondent \u201chad at least the property rights of a bailee,\u201d\nante, at 3, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a trespass to\nchattel only if the injury occurs during the term of the\nbailment. See 8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment \u00a7166, pp. 685\u2013\n686 (2009). So if the GPS device had been installed before\nrespondent\u2019s wife gave him the keys, respondent would\nhave no claim for trespass\u2014and, presumably, no Fourth\nAmendment claim either.\n  Third, under the Court\u2019s theory, the coverage of the\nFourth Amendment may vary from State to State. If the\nevents at issue here had occurred in a community property\nState4 or a State that has adopted the Uniform Marital\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 See,   e.g., Cal. Family Code Ann. \u00a7760 (West 2004).\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                9\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nProperty Act,5 respondent would likely be an owner of\nthe vehicle, and it would not matter whether the GPS was\ninstalled before or after his wife turned over the keys. In\nnon-community-property States, on the other hand, the\nregistration of the vehicle in the name of respondent\u2019s wife\nwould generally be regarded as presumptive evidence that\nshe was the sole owner. See 60 C. J. S., Motor Vehicles\n\u00a7231, pp. 398\u2013399 (2002); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles\n\u00a71208, pp. 859\u2013860 (2007).\n   Fourth, the Court\u2019s reliance on the law of trespass will\npresent particularly vexing problems in cases involving\nsurveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as\nopposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked.\nFor example, suppose that the officers in the present case\nhad followed respondent by surreptitiously activating a\nstolen vehicle detection system that came with the car\nwhen it was purchased. Would the sending of a radio\nsignal to activate this system constitute a trespass to\nchattels? Trespass to chattels has traditionally required a\nphysical touching of the property. See Restatement (Se-\ncond) of Torts \u00a7217 and Comment e (1963 and 1964);\nDobbs, supra, at 123. In recent years, courts have wres-\ntled with the application of this old tort in cases involving\nunwanted electronic contact with computer systems, and\nsome have held that even the transmission of electrons\nthat occurs when a communication is sent from one com-\nputer to another is enough. See, e.g., CompuServe, Inc. v.\nCyber Promotions, Inc. 962 F. Supp. 1015, 1021 (SD Ohio\n1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559,\n1566, n. 6 (1996). But may such decisions be followed in\napplying the Court\u2019s trespass theory? Assuming that\nwhat matters under the Court\u2019s theory is the law of tres-\npass as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Fourth\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 See   Uniform Marital Property Act \u00a74, 9A U.

JONES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nAmendment, do these recent decisions represent a change\nin the law or simply the application of the old tort to new\nsituations?\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n  The Katz expectation-of-privacy test avoids the problems\nand complications noted above, but it is not without its\nown difficulties. It involves a degree of circularity, see\nKyllo, 533 U. S., at 34, and judges are apt to confuse their\nown expectations of privacy with those of the hypothetical\nreasonable person to which the Katz test looks. See\nMinnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 97 (1998) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring). In addition, the Katz test rests on the as-\nsumption that this hypothetical reasonable person has a\nwell-developed and stable set of privacy expectations. But\ntechnology can change those expectations.         Dramatic\ntechnological change may lead to periods in which popular\nexpectations are in flux and may ultimately produce sig-\nnificant changes in popular attitudes. New technology\nmay provide increased convenience or security at the\nexpense of privacy, and many people may find the tradeoff\nworthwhile. And even if the public does not welcome\nthe diminution of privacy that new technology entails,\nthey may eventually reconcile themselves to this develop-\nment as inevitable.6\n  On the other hand, concern about new intrusions on\nprivacy may spur the enactment of legislation to protect\nagainst these intrusions. This is what ultimately hap-\npened with respect to wiretapping.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a72510\u20132522 (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIV), and since that time, the regulation of wiretapping has\nbeen governed primarily by statute and not by case law.7\nIn an ironic sense, although Katz overruled Olmstead,\nChief Justice Taft\u2019s suggestion in the latter case that the\nregulation of wiretapping was a matter better left for\nCongress, see 277 U. S., at 465\u2013466, has been borne out.\n                             B\n   Recent years have seen the emergence of many new\ndevices that permit the monitoring of a person\u2019s move-\nments. In some locales, closed-circuit television video\nmonitoring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll roads, auto-\nmatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the\nmovements of motorists who choose to make use of\nthat convenience. Many motorists purchase cars that are\nequipped with devices that permit a central station to\nascertain the car\u2019s location at any time so that roadside\nassistance may be provided if needed and the car may be\nfound if it is stolen.\n   Perhaps most significant, cell phones and other wireless\ndevices now permit wireless carriers to track and record\nthe location of users\u2014and as of June 2011, it has been\nreported, there were more than 322 million wireless devic-\nes in use in the United States.8 For older phones, the\naccuracy of the location information depends on the den-\nsity of the tower network, but new \u201csmart phones,\u201d which\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 See Kerr, The Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitu-\n\ntional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich.

JONES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nare equipped with a GPS device, permit more precise\ntracking. For example, when a user activates the GPS on\nsuch a phone, a provider is able to monitor the phone\u2019s\nlocation and speed of movement and can then report back\nreal-time traffic conditions after combining (\u201ccrowdsourc-\ning\u201d) the speed of all such phones on any particular road.9\nSimilarly, phone-location-tracking services are offered as\n\u201csocial\u201d tools, allowing consumers to find (or to avoid)\nothers who enroll in these services. The availability and\nuse of these and other new devices will continue to shape\nthe average person\u2019s expectations about the privacy of his\nor her daily movements.\n                              V\n   In the pre-computer age, the greatest protections of\nprivacy were neither constitutional nor statutory, but\npractical. Traditional surveillance for any extended period\nof time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely under-\ntaken. The surveillance at issue in this case\u2014constant\nmonitoring of the location of a vehicle for four weeks\u2014\nwould have required a large team of agents, multiple\nvehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance.10 Only an investi-\ngation of unusual importance could have justified such an\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See, e.g., The bright side of sitting in traffic: Crowdsourcing road\n\ncongestion data, Google Blog, http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/\nbright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html.\n  10 Even with a radio transmitter like those used in United States v.\n\nKnotts, 460 U. S. 276 (1983), or United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705\n(1984), such long-term surveillance would have been exceptionally\ndemanding. The beepers used in those cases merely \u201cemit[ted] periodic\nsignals that [could] be picked up by a radio receiver.\u201d Knotts, 460 U.S.,\nat 277. The signal had a limited range and could be lost if the police\ndid not stay close enough. Indeed, in Knotts itself, officers lost the\nsignal from the beeper, and only \u201cwith the assistance of a monitoring\ndevice located in a helicopter [was] the approximate location of the\nsignal . . . picked up again about one hour later.\u201d Id., at 278.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nexpenditure of law enforcement resources. Devices like\nthe one used in the present case, however, make long-term\nmonitoring relatively easy and cheap. In circumstances\ninvolving dramatic technological change, the best solution\nto privacy concerns may be legislative. See, e.g., Kerr, 102\nMich. L. Rev., at 805\u2013806. A legislative body is well situ-\nated to gauge changing public attitudes, to draw detailed\nlines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a com-\nprehensive way.\n   To date, however, Congress and most States have not\nenacted statutes regulating the use of GPS tracking tech-\nnology for law enforcement purposes. The best that we\ncan do in this case is to apply existing Fourth Amendment\ndoctrine and to ask whether the use of GPS tracking in a\nparticular case involved a degree of intrusion that a rea-\nsonable person would not have anticipated.\n   Under this approach, relatively short-term monitoring\nof a person\u2019s movements on public streets accords with\nexpectations of privacy that our society has recognized\nas reasonable. See Knotts, 460 U. S., at 281\u2013282. But\nthe use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of\nmost offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For\nsuch offenses, society\u2019s expectation has been that law\nenforcement agents and others would not\u2014and indeed, in\nthe main, simply could not\u2014secretly monitor and cata-\nlogue every single movement of an individual\u2019s car for\na very long period. In this case, for four weeks, law en-\nforcement agents tracked every movement that respond-\nent made in the vehicle he was driving. We need not\nidentify with precision the point at which the tracking of\nthis vehicle became a search, for the line was surely\ncrossed before the 4-week mark. Other cases may present\nmore difficult questions. But where uncertainty exists\nwith respect to whether a certain period of GPS surveil\n14                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlance is long enough to constitute a Fourth Amendment\nsearch, the police may always seek a warrant.11 We also\nneed not consider whether prolonged GPS monitoring in\nthe context of investigations involving extraordinary\noffenses would similarly intrude on a constitutionally\nprotected sphere of privacy. In such cases, long-term\ntracking might have been mounted using previously avail-\nable techniques.\n                        *    *     *\n   For these reasons, I conclude that the lengthy monitor-\ning that occurred in this case constituted a search under\nthe Fourth Amendment. I therefore agree with the major-\nity that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 In this case, the agents obtained a warrant, but they did not comply\n\nwith two of the warrant\u2019s restrictions: They did not install the GPS\ndevice within the 10-day period required by the terms of the warrant\nand by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(e)(2)(B)(i), and they did not install the\nGPS device within the District of Columbia, as required by the terms\nof the warrant and by 18 U. S. C. \u00a73117(a) and Rule 41(b)(4). In the\ncourts below the Government did not argue, and has not argued here,\nthat the Fourth Amendment does not impose these precise restrictions\nand that the violation of these restrictions does not demand the sup-\npression of evidence obtained using the tracking device. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gerber, 994 F. 2d 1556, 1559\u20131560 (CA11 1993);\nUnited States v. Burke, 517 F. 2d 377, 386\u2013387 (CA2 1975). Because it\nwas not raised, that question is not before us.\n",

Argued November 8, 2011\u2014Decided January 23, 2012\nThe Government obtained a search warrant permitting it to install a\n  Global-Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle regis-\n  tered to respondent Jones\u2019s wife. The warrant authorized installa-\n  tion in the District of Columbia and within 10 days, but agents in-\n  stalled the device on the 11th day and in Maryland. The Government\n  then tracked the vehicle\u2019s movements for 28 days. It subsequently\n  secured an indictment of Jones and others on drug trafficking con-\n  spiracy charges. The District Court suppressed the GPS data ob-\n  tained while the vehicle was parked at Jones\u2019s residence, but held the\n  remaining data admissible because Jones had no reasonable expecta-\n  tion of privacy when the vehicle was on public streets. Jones was\n  convicted. The D. C. Circuit reversed, concluding that admission of\n  the evidence obtained by warrantless use of the GPS device violated\n  the Fourth Amendment.\nHeld: The Government\u2019s attachment of the GPS device to the vehicle,\n and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, consti-\n tutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) The Fourth Amendment protects the \u201cright of the people to be\n secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unrea-\n sonable searches and seizures.\u201d Here, the Government\u2019s physical in-\n trusion on an \u201ceffect\u201d for the purpose of obtaining information consti-\n tutes a \u201csearch.\u201d This type of encroachment on an area enumerated\n in the Amendment would have been considered a search within the\n meaning of the Amendment at the time it was adopted. Pp. 3\u20134.\n    (b) This conclusion is consistent with this Court\u2019s Fourth Amend-\n ment jurisprudence, which until the latter half of the 20th century\n was tied to common-law trespass. Later cases, which have deviated\n from that exclusively property-based approach, have applied the\n2                      UNITED STATES v.

S. 347, which said that the Fourth Amendment protects a person\u2019s\n    \u201creasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d id., at 360. Here, the Court need\n    not address the Government\u2019s contention that Jones had no \u201creason-\n    able expectation of privacy,\u201d because Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment\n    rights do not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom, the\n    Court must \u201cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against\n    government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u201d\n    Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 34. Katz did not repudiate the\n    understanding that the Fourth Amendment embodies a particular\n    concern for government trespass upon the areas it enumerates. The\n    Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, but\n    not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. See Alderman\n    v. United States, 394 U.

New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, and\n    Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, also do not support the Gov-\n    ernment\u2019s position.

Officers employed various\ninvestigative techniques, including visual surveillance of\nthe nightclub, installation of a camera focused on the front\ndoor of the club, and a pen register and wiretap covering\nJones\u2019s cellular phone.\n  Based in part on information gathered from these\nsources, in 2005 the Government applied to the United\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia for a\nwarrant authorizing the use of an electronic tracking\ndevice on the Jeep Grand Cherokee registered to Jones\u2019s\n2                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwife. A warrant issued, authorizing installation of the de-\nvice in the District of Columbia and within 10 days.\n   On the 11th day, and not in the District of Columbia but\nin Maryland,1 agents installed a GPS tracking device on\nthe undercarriage of the Jeep while it was parked in a\npublic parking lot. Over the next 28 days, the Govern-\nment used the device to track the vehicle\u2019s movements,\nand once had to replace the device\u2019s battery when the\nvehicle was parked in a different public lot in Maryland.\nBy means of signals from multiple satellites, the device\nestablished the vehicle\u2019s location within 50 to 100 feet, and\ncommunicated that location by cellular phone to a Gov-\nernment computer. It relayed more than 2,000 pages of\ndata over the 4-week period.\n   The Government ultimately obtained a multiple-count\nindictment charging Jones and several alleged co-\nconspirators with, as relevant here, conspiracy to distrib-\nute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or\nmore of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in\nviolation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841 and 846. Before trial, Jones\nfiled a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the\nGPS device. The District Court granted the motion only in\npart, suppressing the data obtained while the vehicle was\nparked in the garage adjoining Jones\u2019s residence. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2574690\"><a href=\"/opinion/2574690/united-states-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

It held the remaining data\nadmissible, because \u201c \u2018[a] person traveling in an automo-\nbile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation\nof privacy in his movements from one place to another.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 281\n(1983)). Jones\u2019s trial in October 2006 produced a hung\njury on the conspiracy count.\n   In March 2007, a grand jury returned another indict-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In this litigation, the Government has conceded noncompliance with\n\nthe warrant and has argued only that a warrant was not required.\nUnited States v.

The Government introduced at trial the same GPS-\nderived locational data admitted in the first trial, which\nconnected Jones to the alleged conspirators\u2019 stash house\nthat contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of cocaine,\nand 1 kilogram of cocaine base. The jury returned a guilty\nverdict, and the District Court sentenced Jones to life\nimprisonment.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia Circuit reversed the conviction because of ad-\nmission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use of\nthe GPS device which, it said, violated the Fourth Amend-\nment. United States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544 (2010).\nThe D. C. Circuit denied the Government\u2019s petition for\nrehearing en banc, with four judges dissenting. 625 F. 3d\n766 (2010).

United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 12\n(1977). We hold that the Government\u2019s installation of a\nGPS device on a target\u2019s vehicle,2 and its use of that device\nto monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, constitutes a \u201csearch.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 As we have noted, the Jeep was registered to Jones\u2019s wife. The Gov-\nernment acknowledged, however, that Jones was \u201cthe exclusive driver.\u201d\nId., at 555, n. (internal quotation marks omitted). If Jones was not the\nowner he had at least the property rights of a bailee. The Court of\nAppeals concluded that the vehicle\u2019s registration did not affect his\nability to make a Fourth Amendment objection, ibid., and the Govern-\nment has not challenged that determination here. We therefore do not\nconsider the Fourth Amendment significance of Jones\u2019s status.\n4                UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  It is important to be clear about what occurred in this\ncase: The Government physically occupied private proper-\nty for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no\ndoubt that such a physical intrusion would have been\nconsidered a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment when it was adopted. Entick v. Carrington,\n95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C. P. 1765), is a \u201ccase we have described\nas a \u2018monument of English freedom\u2019 \u2018undoubtedly familiar\u2019\nto \u2018every American statesman\u2019 at the time the Constitution\nwas adopted, and considered to be \u2018the true and ultimate\nexpression of constitutional law\u2019 \u201d with regard to search\nand seizure. Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 596\n(1989) (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626\n(1886)). In that case, Lord Camden expressed in plain\nterms the significance of property rights in search-and-\nseizure analysis:\n    \u201c[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred,\n    that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour\u2019s close\n    without his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though\n    he does no damage at all; if he will tread upon his\n    neighbour\u2019s ground, he must justify it by law.\u201d Entick,\n    supra, at 817.\nThe text of the Fourth Amendment reflects its close con-\nnection to property, since otherwise it would have referred\nsimply to \u201cthe right of the people to be secure against\nunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d; the phrase \u201cin their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d would have been\nsuperfluous.\n  Consistent with this understanding, our Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law tres-\npass, at least until the latter half of the 20th century.\nKyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001); Kerr, The\nFourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional\nMyths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801,\n816 (2004). Thus, in Olmstead v.

In Katz v. United\nStates, 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967), we said that \u201cthe Fourth\nAmendment protects people, not places,\u201d and found a\nviolation in attachment of an eavesdropping device to a\npublic telephone booth. Our later cases have applied the\nanalysis of Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in that case,\nwhich said that a violation occurs when government offic-\ners violate a person\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d\nid., at 360. See, e.g., Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334\n(2000); California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207 (1986); Smith\nv. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979).\n   The Government contends that the Harlan standard\nshows that no search occurred here, since Jones had no\n\u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in the area of the Jeep\naccessed by Government agents (its underbody) and in the\nlocations of the Jeep on the public roads, which were\nvisible to all. But we need not address the Government\u2019s\ncontentions, because Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights\ndo not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom,\nwe must \u201cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy\nagainst government that existed when the Fourth\nAmendment was adopted.\u201d Kyllo, supra, at 34. As ex-\nplained, for most of our history the Fourth Amendment\nwas understood to embody a particular concern for gov-\nernment trespass upon the areas (\u201cpersons, houses, pa-\npers, and effects\u201d) it enumerates.3 Katz did not repudiate\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurrence (hereinafter concurrence) doubts the\n\nwisdom of our approach because \u201cit is almost impossible to think of\nlate-18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in\nthis case.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment).

S. 165, 176 (1969). \u201c[W]e [do not] believe\nthat Katz, by holding that the Fourth Amendment protects\npersons and their private conversations, was intended\nto withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment\nextends to the home . . . .\u201d Id., at 180.\n  More recently, in Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56\n(1992), the Court unanimously rejected the argument that\nalthough a \u201cseizure\u201d had occurred \u201cin a \u2018technical\u2019 sense\u201d\nwhen a trailer home was forcibly removed, id., at 62, no\nFourth Amendment violation occurred because law en-\nforcement had not \u201cinvade[d] the [individuals\u2019] privacy,\u201d\nid., at 60. Katz, the Court explained, established that\n\u201cproperty rights are not the sole measure of Fourth\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nin the target\u2019s coach in order to track its movements. Ibid. There is no\ndoubt that the information gained by that trespassory activity would be\nthe product of an unlawful search\u2014whether that information consisted\nof the conversations occurring in the coach, or of the destinations to\nwhich the coach traveled.\n   In any case, it is quite irrelevant whether there was an 18th-century\nanalog. Whatever new methods of investigation may be devised, our\ntask, at a minimum, is to decide whether the action in question would\nhave constituted a \u201csearch\u201d within the original meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment. Where, as here, the Government obtains information by\nphysically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search\nhas undoubtedly occurred.\n   4 Thus, the concurrence\u2019s attempt to recast Alderman as meaning that\n\nindividuals have a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy in all conversa-\ntions that [take] place under their roof,\u201d post, at 6\u20137, is foreclosed by\nthe Court\u2019s opinion. The Court took as a given that the homeowner\u2019s\n\u201cconversational privacy\u201d had not been violated.\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment violations,\u201d but did not \u201csnuf[f ] out the previ-\nously recognized protection for property.\u201d 506 U. S., at 64.\nAs Justice Brennan explained in his concurrence in\nKnotts, Katz did not erode the principle \u201cthat, when the\nGovernment does engage in physical intrusion of a consti-\ntutionally protected area in order to obtain information,\nthat intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201d 460 U. S., at 286 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). We have embodied that preservation of past\nrights in our very definition of \u201creasonable expectation\nof privacy\u201d which we have said to be an expectation \u201cthat\nhas a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by\nreference to concepts of real or personal property law or\nto understandings that are recognized and permitted by\nsociety.\u201d Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 88 (1998)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Katz did not narrow\nthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s scope.5\n   The Government contends that several of our post-Katz\ncases foreclose the conclusion that what occurred here\nconstituted a search. It relies principally on two cases in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The  concurrence notes that post-Katz we have explained that \u201c \u2018an\nactual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a consti-\ntutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6 (quoting United States v. Karo, 468 U. S.\n705, 713 (1984)). That is undoubtedly true, and undoubtedly irrele-\nvant. Karo was considering whether a seizure occurred, and as the\nconcurrence explains, a seizure of property occurs, not when there is a\ntrespass, but \u201cwhen there is some meaningful interference with an\nindividual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u201d Post, at 2 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Likewise with a search. Trespass alone\ndoes not qualify, but there must be conjoined with that what was\npresent here: an attempt to find something or to obtain information.\n   Related to this, and similarly irrelevant, is the concurrence\u2019s point\nthat, if analyzed separately, neither the installation of the device nor\nits use would constitute a Fourth Amendment search. See ibid. Of\ncourse not. A trespass on \u201chouses\u201d or \u201ceffects,\u201d or a Katz invasion of\nprivacy, is not alone a search unless it is done to obtain information;\nand the obtaining of information is not alone a search unless it is\nachieved by such a trespass or invasion of privacy.\n8                    UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich we rejected Fourth Amendment challenges to\n\u201cbeepers,\u201d electronic tracking devices that represent an-\nother form of electronic monitoring. The first case, Knotts,\nupheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the use of a\n\u201cbeeper\u201d that had been placed in a container of chloroform,\nallowing law enforcement to monitor the location of the\ncontainer. 460 U. S., at 278. We said that there had been\nno infringement of Knotts\u2019 reasonable expectation of pri-\nvacy since the information obtained\u2014the location of the\nautomobile carrying the container on public roads, and\nthe location of the off-loaded container in open fields near\nKnotts\u2019 cabin\u2014had been voluntarily conveyed to the pub-\nlic.6 Id., at 281\u2013282. But as we have discussed, the Katz\nreasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to,\nnot substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. The\nholding in Knotts addressed only the former, since the\nlatter was not at issue. The beeper had been placed in\nthe container before it came into Knotts\u2019 possession, with\nthe consent of the then-owner. 460 U. S., at 278. Knotts\ndid not challenge that installation, and we specifically de-\nclined to consider its effect on the Fourth Amendment\nanalysis. Id., at 279, n. Knotts would be relevant, per-\nhaps, if the Government were making the argument that\nwhat would otherwise be an unconstitutional search is\nnot such where it produces only public information. The\nGovernment does not make that argument, and we know\nof no case that would support it.\n   The second \u201cbeeper\u201d case, United States v. Karo, 468\nU. S. 705 (1984), does not suggest a different conclusion.\nThere we addressed the question left open by Knotts,\nwhether the installation of a beeper in a container\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Knotts noted the \u201climited use which the government made of the\n\nsignals from this particular beeper,\u201d 460 U. S., at 284; and reserved the\nquestion whether \u201cdifferent constitutional principles may be applicable\u201d\nto \u201cdragnet-type law enforcement practices\u201d of the type that GPS\ntracking made possible here, ibid.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\namounted to a search or seizure. 468 U. S., at 713. As in\nKnotts, at the time the beeper was installed the container\nbelonged to a third party, and it did not come into posses-\nsion of the defendant until later. 468 U. S., at 708. Thus,\nthe specific question we considered was whether the in-\nstallation \u201cwith the consent of the original owner consti-\ntute[d] a search or seizure . . . when the container is deliv-\nered to a buyer having no knowledge of the presence of the\nbeeper.\u201d Id., at 707 (emphasis added). We held not. The\nGovernment, we said, came into physical contact with\nthe container only before it belonged to the defendant Karo;\nand the transfer of the container with the unmonitored\nbeeper inside did not convey any information and thus did\nnot invade Karo\u2019s privacy. See id., at 712. That conclu-\nsion is perfectly consistent with the one we reach here.\nKaro accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and\nall, and was therefore not entitled to object to the beeper\u2019s\npresence, even though it was used to monitor the contain-\ner\u2019s location. Cf. On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747,\n751\u2013752 (1952) (no search or seizure where an informant,\nwho was wearing a concealed microphone, was invited into\nthe defendant\u2019s business). Jones, who possessed the Jeep\nat the time the Government trespassorily inserted the\ninformation-gathering device, is on much different footing.\n   The Government also points to our exposition in New\nYork v. Class, 475 U. S. 106 (1986), that \u201c[t]he exterior of\na car . . . is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine\nit does not constitute a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 114. That state-\nment is of marginal relevance here since, as the Govern-\nment acknowledges, \u201cthe officers in this case did more\nthan conduct a visual inspection of respondent\u2019s vehicle,\u201d\nBrief for United States 41 (emphasis added). By attaching\nthe device to the Jeep, officers encroached on a protected\narea. In Class itself we suggested that this would make a\ndifference, for we concluded that an officer\u2019s momentary\nreaching into the interior of a vehicle did constitute a\n10                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsearch.7 475 U. S., at 114\u2013115.\n   Finally, the Government\u2019s position gains little support\nfrom our conclusion in Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S.\n170 (1984), that officers\u2019 information-gathering intrusion\non an \u201copen field\u201d did not constitute a Fourth Amendment\nsearch even though it was a trespass at common law, id.,\nat 183. Quite simply, an open field, unlike the curtilage of\na home, see United States v. Dunn, 480 U. S. 294, 300\n(1987), is not one of those protected areas enumerated in\nthe Fourth Amendment. Oliver, supra, at 176\u2013177. See\nalso Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 59 (1924). The\nGovernment\u2019s physical intrusion on such an area\u2014unlike\nits intrusion on the \u201ceffect\u201d at issue here\u2014is of no Fourth\nAmendment significance.8\n                           B\n  The concurrence begins by accusing us of applying\n\u201c18th-century tort law.\u201d Post, at 1. That is a distortion.\nWhat we apply is an 18th-century guarantee against un-\nreasonable searches, which we believe must provide at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  Government also points to Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583\n(1974), in which the Court rejected the claim that the inspection of an\nimpounded vehicle\u2019s tire tread and the collection of paint scrapings\nfrom its exterior violated the Fourth Amendment. Whether the plural-\nity said so because no search occurred or because the search was rea-\nsonable is unclear. Compare id., at 591 (opinion of Blackmun, J.)\n(\u201c[W]e fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed\u201d),\nwith id., at 592 (\u201cUnder circumstances such as these, where probable\ncause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not\nunreasonable . . . \u201d).\n   8 Thus, our theory is not that the Fourth Amendment is concerned\n\nwith \u201cany technical trespass that led to the gathering of evidence.\u201d\nPost, at 3 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis added). The\nFourth Amendment protects against trespassory searches only with\nregard to those items (\u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d) that it\nenumerates. The trespass that occurred in Oliver may properly be\nunderstood as a \u201csearch,\u201d but not one \u201cin the constitutional sense.\u201d 466\nU. S., at 170, 183.\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na minimum the degree of protection it afforded when it\nwas adopted. The concurrence does not share that belief.\nIt would apply exclusively Katz\u2019s reasonable-expectation-\nof-privacy test, even when that eliminates rights that\npreviously existed.\n   The concurrence faults our approach for \u201cpresent[ing]\nparticularly vexing problems\u201d in cases that do not involve\nphysical contact, such as those that involve the transmis-\nsion of electronic signals. Post, at 9. We entirely fail to\nunderstand that point. For unlike the concurrence, which\nwould make Katz the exclusive test, we do not make tres-\npass the exclusive test. Situations involving merely the\ntransmission of electronic signals without trespass would\nremain subject to Katz analysis.\n   In fact, it is the concurrence\u2019s insistence on the exclusiv-\nity of the Katz test that needlessly leads us into \u201cparticu-\nlarly vexing problems\u201d in the present case. This Court has\nto date not deviated from the understanding that mere\nvisual observation does not constitute a search. See Kyllo,\n533 U. S., at 31\u201332. We accordingly held in Knotts that\n\u201c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thorough-\nfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his\nmovements from one place to another.\u201d 460 U. S., at 281.\nThus, even assuming that the concurrence is correct to\nsay that \u201c[t]raditional surveillance\u201d of Jones for a 4-week\nperiod \u201cwould have required a large team of agents, multi-\nple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance,\u201d post, at 12,\nour cases suggest that such visual observation is constitu-\ntionally permissible. It may be that achieving the same\nresult through electronic means, without an accompany-\ning trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy,\nbut the present case does not require us to answer that\nquestion.\n   And answering it affirmatively leads us needlessly into\nadditional thorny problems. The concurrence posits that\n\u201crelatively short-term monitoring of a person\u2019s movements\n12               UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non public streets\u201d is okay, but that \u201cthe use of longer term\nGPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses\u201d is no\ngood. Post, at 13 (emphasis added). That introduces yet\nanother novelty into our jurisprudence. There is no prece-\ndent for the proposition that whether a search has oc-\ncurred depends on the nature of the crime being investi-\ngated. And even accepting that novelty, it remains\nunexplained why a 4-week investigation is \u201csurely\u201d too\nlong and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy involving sub-\nstantial amounts of cash and narcotics is not an \u201cextra-\nordinary offens[e]\u201d which may permit longer observation.\nSee post, at 13\u201314. What of a 2-day monitoring of a\nsuspected purveyor of stolen electronics? Or of a 6-month\nmonitoring of a suspected terrorist? We may have to\ngrapple with these \u201cvexing problems\u201d in some future case\nwhere a classic trespassory search is not involved and\nresort must be had to Katz analysis; but there is no reason\nfor rushing forward to resolve them here.\n                             III\n  The Government argues in the alternative that even if\nthe attachment and use of the device was a search, it was\nreasonable\u2014and thus lawful\u2014under the Fourth Amend-\nment because \u201cofficers had reasonable suspicion, and in-\ndeed probable cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader\nin a large-scale cocaine distribution conspiracy.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 50\u201351. We have no occasion to consider this\nargument. The Government did not raise it below, and\nthe D. C. Circuit therefore did not address it. See 625\nF. 3d, at 767 (Ginsburg, Tatel, and Griffith, JJ., concur-\nring in denial of rehearing en banc). We consider the\nargument forfeited. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537\nU.

In this case, the Gov-\nernment installed a Global Positioning System (GPS)\ntracking device on respondent Antoine Jones\u2019 Jeep without\na valid warrant and without Jones\u2019 consent, then used\nthat device to monitor the Jeep\u2019s movements over the\ncourse of four weeks. The Government usurped Jones\u2019\nproperty for the purpose of conducting surveillance on\nhim, thereby invading privacy interests long afforded, and\nundoubtedly entitled to, Fourth Amendment protection.\nSee, e.g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511\u2013\n512 (1961).\n   Of course, the Fourth Amendment is not concerned only\nwith trespassory intrusions on property. See, e.g., Kyllo v.\nUnited States, 533 U. S. 27, 31\u201333 (2001). Rather, even in\nthe absence of a trespass, \u201ca Fourth Amendment search\noccurs when the government violates a subjective expecta-\ntion of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.\u201d Id.,\nat 33; see also Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741\n(1979); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361 (1967)\n(Harlan, J., concurring). In Katz, this Court enlarged its\nthen-prevailing focus on property rights by announcing\n2                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthat the reach of the Fourth Amendment does not \u201cturn\nupon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion.\u201d Id.,\nat 353. As the majority\u2019s opinion makes clear, however,\nKatz\u2019s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test augmented,\nbut did not displace or diminish, the common-law trespas-\nsory test that preceded it. Ante, at 8. Thus, \u201cwhen the\nGovernment does engage in physical intrusion of a consti-\ntutionally protected area in order to obtain information,\nthat intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201d United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286\n(1983) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); see also, e.g.,\nRakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 144, n. 12 (1978). JUSTICE\nALITO\u2019s approach, which discounts altogether the constitu-\ntional relevance of the Government\u2019s physical intrusion on\nJones\u2019 Jeep, erodes that longstanding protection for priva-\ncy expectations inherent in items of property that people\npossess or control. See post, at 5\u20137 (opinion concurring in\njudgment). By contrast, the trespassory test applied in\nthe majority\u2019s opinion reflects an irreducible constitutional\nminimum: When the Government physically invades\npersonal property to gather information, a search occurs.\nThe reaffirmation of that principle suffices to decide this\ncase.\n   Nonetheless, as JUSTICE ALITO notes, physical intrusion\nis now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance. Post, at\n9\u201312. With increasing regularity, the Government will be\ncapable of duplicating the monitoring undertaken in this\ncase by enlisting factory- or owner-installed vehicle track-\ning devices or GPS-enabled smartphones. See United\nStates v. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d 1120, 1125 (CA9 2010)\n(Kozinski, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc). In cases of electronic or other novel modes of sur-\nveillance that do not depend upon a physical invasion\non property, the majority opinion\u2019s trespassory test may\nprovide little guidance. But \u201c[s]ituations involving merely\nthe transmission of electronic signals without trespass\n                  Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nwould remain subject to Katz analysis.\u201d Ante, at 11. As\nJUSTICE ALITO incisively observes, the same technological\nadvances that have made possible nontrespassory surveil-\nlance techniques will also affect the Katz test by shaping\nthe evolution of societal privacy expectations. Post, at\n10\u201311. Under that rubric, I agree with JUSTICE ALITO that,\nat the very least, \u201clonger term GPS monitoring in inves-\ntigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of\nprivacy.\u201d Post, at 13.\n   In cases involving even short-term monitoring, some\nunique attributes of GPS surveillance relevant to the Katz\nanalysis will require particular attention. GPS monitoring\ngenerates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\u2019s\npublic movements that reflects a wealth of detail about\nher familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual\nassociations. See, e.g., People v. Weaver, 12 N. Y. 3d 433,\n441\u2013442, 909 N. E. 2d 1195, 1199 (2009) (\u201cDisclosed in\n[GPS] data . . . will be trips the indisputably private na-\nture of which takes little imagination to conjure: trips\nto the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic,\nthe AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal\ndefense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meet-\ning, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and\non and on\u201d). The Government can store such records\nand efficiently mine them for information years into the\nfuture. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d, at 1124 (opinion of\nKozinski, C. J.). And because GPS monitoring is cheap\nin comparison to conventional surveillance techniques and,\nby design, proceeds surreptitiously, it evades the ordinary\nchecks that constrain abusive law enforcement practices:\n\u201climited police resources and community hostility.\u201d Illi-\nnois v. Lidster, 540 U. S. 419, 426 (2004).\n   Awareness that the Government may be watching chills\nassociational and expressive freedoms. And the Govern-\nment\u2019s unrestrained power to assemble data that reveal\nprivate aspects of identity is susceptible to abuse. The net\n4                     UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nresult is that GPS monitoring\u2014by making available at a\nrelatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate\ninformation about any person whom the Government, in\nits unfettered discretion, chooses to track\u2014may \u201calter the\nrelationship between citizen and government in a way\nthat is inimical to democratic society.\u201d United States v.\nCuevas-Perez, 640 F. 3d 272, 285 (CA7 2011) (Flaum, J.,\nconcurring).\n   I would take these attributes of GPS monitoring into\naccount when considering the existence of a reasonable\nsocietal expectation of privacy in the sum of one\u2019s public\nmovements. I would ask whether people reasonably ex-\npect that their movements will be recorded and aggregat-\ned in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain,\nmore or less at will, their political and religious beliefs,\nsexual habits, and so on. I do not regard as dispositive\nthe fact that the Government might obtain the fruits of\nGPS monitoring through lawful conventional surveillance\ntechniques. See Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 35, n. 2; ante, at 11\n(leaving open the possibility that duplicating traditional\nsurveillance \u201cthrough electronic means, without an ac-\ncompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of\nprivacy\u201d).

E.g., Smith, 442 U. S., at 742; United States v.\nMiller, 425 U. S. 435, 443 (1976). This approach is ill\nsuited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great\ndeal of information about themselves to third parties in\nthe course of carrying out mundane tasks. People disclose\nthe phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellu-\nlar providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail\naddresses with which they correspond to their Internet\nservice providers; and the books, groceries, and medi-\ncations they purchase to online retailers. Perhaps, as\nJUSTICE ALITO notes, some people may find the \u201ctradeoff \u201d\nof privacy for convenience \u201cworthwhile,\u201d or come to accept\nthis \u201cdiminution of privacy\u201d as \u201cinevitable,\u201d post, at 10,\nand perhaps not. I for one doubt that people would accept\nwithout complaint the warrantless disclosure to the Gov-\nernment of a list of every Web site they had visited in the\nlast week, or month, or year.

Ironically, the Court\nhas chosen to decide this case based on 18th-century\ntort law. By attaching a small GPS device1 to the under-\nside of the vehicle that respondent drove, the law enforce-\nment officers in this case engaged in conduct that might\nhave provided grounds in 1791 for a suit for trespass\nto chattels.2 And for this reason, the Court concludes,\nthe installation and use of the GPS device constituted\na search.

Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton,\n& D. Owen, Prosser & Keeton on Law of Torts 87 (5th ed. 1984) (here-\ninafter Prosser & Keeton). Here, there was no actual damage to the\nvehicle to which the GPS device was attached.\n2                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  This holding, in my judgment, is unwise. It strains the\nlanguage of the Fourth Amendment; it has little if any\nsupport in current Fourth Amendment case law; and it is\nhighly artificial.\n  I would analyze the question presented in this case by\nasking whether respondent\u2019s reasonable expectations of\nprivacy were violated by the long-term monitoring of the\nmovements of the vehicle he drove.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  The Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable\nsearches and seizures,\u201d and the Court makes very little\neffort to explain how the attachment or use of the GPS\ndevice fits within these terms. The Court does not contend\nthat there was a seizure. A seizure of property occurs\nwhen there is \u201csome meaningful interference with an in-\ndividual\u2019s possessory interests in that property,\u201d United\nStates v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109, 113 (1984), and here\nthere was none. Indeed, the success of the surveillance\ntechnique that the officers employed was dependent on\nthe fact that the GPS did not interfere in any way with\nthe operation of the vehicle, for if any such interference had\nbeen detected, the device might have been discovered.\n  The Court does claim that the installation and use of the\nGPS constituted a search, see ante, at 3\u20134, but this con-\nclusion is dependent on the questionable proposition that\nthese two procedures cannot be separated for purposes of\nFourth Amendment analysis. If these two procedures are\nanalyzed separately, it is not at all clear from the Court\u2019s\nopinion why either should be regarded as a search. It is\nclear that the attachment of the GPS device was not itself\na search; if the device had not functioned or if the officers\nhad not used it, no information would have been obtained.\nAnd the Court does not contend that the use of the device\nconstituted a search either. On the contrary, the Court\n                    Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                   3\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\naccepts the holding in United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S.\n276 (1983), that the use of a surreptitiously planted elec-\ntronic device to monitor a vehicle\u2019s movements on public\nroads did not amount to a search. See ante, at 7.\n   The Court argues\u2014and I agree\u2014that \u201cwe must \u2018assur[e]\npreservation of that degree of privacy against government\nthat existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 5 (quoting Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27,\n34 (2001)). But it is almost impossible to think of late-\n18th-century situations that are analogous to what took\nplace in this case. (Is it possible to imagine a case in\nwhich a constable secreted himself somewhere in a coach\nand remained there for a period of time in order to monitor\nthe movements of the coach\u2019s owner?3) The Court\u2019s theory\nseems to be that the concept of a search, as originally un-\nderstood, comprehended any technical trespass that led\nto the gathering of evidence, but we know that this is in-\ncorrect. At common law, any unauthorized intrusion on\nprivate property was actionable, see Prosser & Keeton 75,\nbut a trespass on open fields, as opposed to the \u201ccurtilage\u201d\nof a home, does not fall within the scope of the Fourth\nAmendment because private property outside the curtilage\nis not part of a \u201chous[e]\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment. See Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170\n(1984); Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924).\n                            B\n  The Court\u2019s reasoning in this case is very similar to that\nin the Court\u2019s early decisions involving wiretapping and\nelectronic eavesdropping, namely, that a technical tres-\npass followed by the gathering of evidence constitutes a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3The Court suggests that something like this might have occurred in\n1791, but this would have required either a gigantic coach, a very tiny\nconstable, or both\u2014not to mention a constable with incredible fortitude\nand patience.\n4                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsearch. In the early electronic surveillance cases, the\nCourt concluded that a Fourth Amendment search oc-\ncurred when private conversations were monitored as a\nresult of an \u201cunauthorized physical penetration into the\npremises occupied\u201d by the defendant. Silverman v. United\nStates, 365 U. S. 505, 509 (1961). In Silverman, police\nofficers listened to conversations in an attached home by\ninserting a \u201cspike mike\u201d through the wall that this house\nshared with the vacant house next door. Id., at 506. This\nprocedure was held to be a search because the mike made\ncontact with a heating duct on the other side of the wall\nand thus \u201cusurp[ed] . . . an integral part of the premises.\u201d\nId., at 511.\n  By contrast, in cases in which there was no trespass, it\nwas held that there was no search. Thus, in Olmstead v.\nUnited States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), the Court found that\nthe Fourth Amendment did not apply because \u201c[t]he taps\nfrom house lines were made in the streets near the\nhouses.\u201d Id., at 457. Similarly, the Court concluded that no\nsearch occurred in Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S.\n129, 135 (1942), where a \u201cdetectaphone\u201d was placed on the\nouter wall of defendant\u2019s office for the purpose of overhear-\ning conversations held within the room.\n  This trespass-based rule was repeatedly criticized. In\nOlmstead, Justice Brandeis wrote that it was \u201cimmaterial\nwhere the physical connection with the telephone wires\nwas made.\u201d 277 U. S., at 479 (dissenting opinion). Al-\nthough a private conversation transmitted by wire did not\nfall within the literal words of the Fourth Amendment, he\nargued, the Amendment should be understood as prohibit-\ning \u201cevery unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon\nthe privacy of the individual.\u201d Id., at 478. See also, e.g.,\nSilverman, supra, at 513 (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201cThe\nconcept of \u2018an unauthorized physical penetration into the\npremises,\u2019 on which the present decision rests seems to me\nbeside the point.

United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), finally did\naway with the old approach, holding that a trespass was\nnot required for a Fourth Amendment violation. Katz in-\nvolved the use of a listening device that was attached to\nthe outside of a public telephone booth and that allowed\npolice officers to eavesdrop on one end of the target\u2019s\nphone conversation. This procedure did not physically\nintrude on the area occupied by the target, but the Katz\nCourt \u201crepudiate[ed]\u201d the old doctrine, Rakas v. Illinois,\n439 U. S. 128, 143 (1978), and held that \u201c[t]he fact that the\nelectronic device employed . . . did not happen to penetrate\nthe wall of the booth can have no constitutional signifi-\ncance,\u201d 389 U. S., at 353 (\u201c[T]he reach of th[e] [Fourth]\nAmendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a\nphysical intrusion into any given enclosure\u201d); see Rakas,\nsupra, at 143 (describing Katz as holding that the \u201cca-\npacity to claim the protection for the Fourth Amendment\ndepends not upon a property right in the invaded place but\nupon whether the person who claims the protection of the\nAmendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the\ninvaded place\u201d); Kyllo, supra, at 32 (\u201cWe have since decou-\npled violation of a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights\nfrom trespassory violation of his property\u201d). What mattered,\nthe Court now held, was whether the conduct at issue\n\u201cviolated the privacy upon which [the defendant] justifi-\nably relied while using the telephone booth.\u201d Katz, supra,\n6                 UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nat 353.\n  Under this approach, as the Court later put it when\naddressing the relevance of a technical trespass, \u201can actu-\nal trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish\na constitutional violation.\u201d United States v. Karo, 468\nU. S. 705, 713 (1984) (emphasis added). Ibid. (\u201cCom-\npar[ing] Katz v. United States, 389 U.

In Oliver, the Court\nwrote:\n    \u201cThe existence of a property right is but one element\n    in determining whether expectations of privacy are\n    legitimate. \u2018The premise that property interests con-\n    trol the right of the Government to search and seize\n    has been discredited.\u2019 Katz, 389 U. S., at 353, (quot-\n    ing Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304 (1967);\n    some internal quotation marks omitted).\u201d 466 U. S.,\n    at 183.\n                              II\n  The majority suggests that two post-Katz decisions\u2014\nSoldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56 (1992), and Alderman\nv. United States, 394 U. S. 165 (1969)\u2014show that a tech-\nnical trespass is sufficient to establish the existence of a\nsearch, but they provide little support.\n  In Soldal, the Court held that towing away a trailer\nhome without the owner\u2019s consent constituted a seizure\neven if this did not invade the occupants\u2019 personal privacy.\nBut in the present case, the Court does not find that there\nwas a seizure, and it is clear that none occurred.\n  In Alderman, the Court held that the Fourth Amend-\nment rights of homeowners were implicated by the use of a\nsurreptitiously planted listening device to monitor third-\nparty conversations that occurred within their home. See\n394 U. S., at 176\u2013180. Alderman is best understood to\n                  Cite as: 565 U.

See Rakas, 439 U. S., at 144, n. 12 (citing Alderman\nfor the proposition that \u201cthe Court has not altogether\nabandoned use of property concepts in determining the\npresence or absence of the privacy interests protected by\nthat Amendment\u201d); 439 U. S., at 153 (Powell, J., concur-\nring) (citing Alderman for the proposition that \u201cproperty\nrights reflect society\u2019s explicit recognition of a person\u2019s au-\nthority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and there-\nfore should be considered in determining whether an\nindividual\u2019s expectations of privacy are reasonable); Karo,\nsupra, at 732 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part) (citing Alderman in support of the proposition\nthat \u201ca homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy\nin the contents of his home, including items owned by\nothers\u201d).\n  In sum, the majority is hard pressed to find support in\npost-Katz cases for its trespass-based theory.\n                               III\n   Disharmony with a substantial body of existing case law\nis only one of the problems with the Court\u2019s approach in\nthis case.\n   I will briefly note four others. First, the Court\u2019s reason-\ning largely disregards what is really important (the use of\na GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking) and instead\nattaches great significance to something that most would\nview as relatively minor (attaching to the bottom of a car a\nsmall, light object that does not interfere in any way with\nthe car\u2019s operation). Attaching such an object is generally\nregarded as so trivial that it does not provide a basis for\nrecovery under modern tort law. See Prosser & Keeton\n\u00a714, at 87 (harmless or trivial contact with personal prop-\nerty not actionable); D. Dobbs, Law of Torts 124 (2000)\n(same). But under the Court\u2019s reasoning, this conduct\n8                         UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                        ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nmay violate the Fourth Amendment. By contrast, if long-\nterm monitoring can be accomplished without committing\na technical trespass\u2014suppose, for example, that the Fed-\neral Government required or persuaded auto manufactur-\ners to include a GPS tracking device in every car\u2014the\nCourt\u2019s theory would provide no protection.\n  Second, the Court\u2019s approach leads to incongruous\nresults. If the police attach a GPS device to a car and use\nthe device to follow the car for even a brief time, under the\nCourt\u2019s theory, the Fourth Amendment applies. But if the\npolice follow the same car for a much longer period using\nunmarked cars and aerial assistance, this tracking is not\nsubject to any Fourth Amendment constraints.\n  In the present case, the Fourth Amendment applies, the\nCourt concludes, because the officers installed the GPS\ndevice after respondent\u2019s wife, to whom the car was regis-\ntered, turned it over to respondent for his exclusive use.\nSee ante, at 8. But if the GPS had been attached prior to\nthat time, the Court\u2019s theory would lead to a different\nresult. The Court proceeds on the assumption that re-\nspondent \u201chad at least the property rights of a bailee,\u201d\nante, at 3, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a trespass to\nchattel only if the injury occurs during the term of the\nbailment. See 8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment \u00a7166, pp. 685\u2013\n686 (2009). So if the GPS device had been installed before\nrespondent\u2019s wife gave him the keys, respondent would\nhave no claim for trespass\u2014and, presumably, no Fourth\nAmendment claim either.\n  Third, under the Court\u2019s theory, the coverage of the\nFourth Amendment may vary from State to State. If the\nevents at issue here had occurred in a community property\nState4 or a State that has adopted the Uniform Marital\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 See,   e.g., Cal. Family Code Ann. \u00a7760 (West 2004).\n                      Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)                9\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nProperty Act,5 respondent would likely be an owner of\nthe vehicle, and it would not matter whether the GPS was\ninstalled before or after his wife turned over the keys. In\nnon-community-property States, on the other hand, the\nregistration of the vehicle in the name of respondent\u2019s wife\nwould generally be regarded as presumptive evidence that\nshe was the sole owner. See 60 C. J. S., Motor Vehicles\n\u00a7231, pp. 398\u2013399 (2002); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles\n\u00a71208, pp. 859\u2013860 (2007).\n   Fourth, the Court\u2019s reliance on the law of trespass will\npresent particularly vexing problems in cases involving\nsurveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as\nopposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked.\nFor example, suppose that the officers in the present case\nhad followed respondent by surreptitiously activating a\nstolen vehicle detection system that came with the car\nwhen it was purchased. Would the sending of a radio\nsignal to activate this system constitute a trespass to\nchattels? Trespass to chattels has traditionally required a\nphysical touching of the property. See Restatement (Se-\ncond) of Torts \u00a7217 and Comment e (1963 and 1964);\nDobbs, supra, at 123. In recent years, courts have wres-\ntled with the application of this old tort in cases involving\nunwanted electronic contact with computer systems, and\nsome have held that even the transmission of electrons\nthat occurs when a communication is sent from one com-\nputer to another is enough.

It involves a degree of circularity, see\nKyllo, 533 U. S., at 34, and judges are apt to confuse their\nown expectations of privacy with those of the hypothetical\nreasonable person to which the Katz test looks. See\nMinnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 97 (1998) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring). In addition, the Katz test rests on the as-\nsumption that this hypothetical reasonable person has a\nwell-developed and stable set of privacy expectations. But\ntechnology can change those expectations.         Dramatic\ntechnological change may lead to periods in which popular\nexpectations are in flux and may ultimately produce sig-\nnificant changes in popular attitudes. New technology\nmay provide increased convenience or security at the\nexpense of privacy, and many people may find the tradeoff\nworthwhile. And even if the public does not welcome\nthe diminution of privacy that new technology entails,\nthey may eventually reconcile themselves to this develop-\nment as inevitable.6\n  On the other hand, concern about new intrusions on\nprivacy may spur the enactment of legislation to protect\nagainst these intrusions. This is what ultimately hap-\npened with respect to wiretapping.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a72510\u20132522 (2006 ed. and Supp.\nIV), and since that time, the regulation of wiretapping has\nbeen governed primarily by statute and not by case law.7\nIn an ironic sense, although Katz overruled Olmstead,\nChief Justice Taft\u2019s suggestion in the latter case that the\nregulation of wiretapping was a matter better left for\nCongress, see 277 U. S., at 465\u2013466, has been borne out.\n                             B\n   Recent years have seen the emergence of many new\ndevices that permit the monitoring of a person\u2019s move-\nments. In some locales, closed-circuit television video\nmonitoring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll roads, auto-\nmatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the\nmovements of motorists who choose to make use of\nthat convenience. Many motorists purchase cars that are\nequipped with devices that permit a central station to\nascertain the car\u2019s location at any time so that roadside\nassistance may be provided if needed and the car may be\nfound if it is stolen.\n   Perhaps most significant, cell phones and other wireless\ndevices now permit wireless carriers to track and record\nthe location of users\u2014and as of June 2011, it has been\nreported, there were more than 322 million wireless devic-\nes in use in the United States.8 For older phones, the\naccuracy of the location information depends on the den-\nsity of the tower network, but new \u201csmart phones,\u201d which\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 See Kerr, The Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitu-\n\ntional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801, 850\u2013851\n(2004) (hereinafter Kerr).\n   8 See CTIA Consumer Info, 50 Wireless Quick Facts, http://www.\n\nctia.org/consumer_info/index.cfm/AID/10323.\n12                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nare equipped with a GPS device, permit more precise\ntracking. For example, when a user activates the GPS on\nsuch a phone, a provider is able to monitor the phone\u2019s\nlocation and speed of movement and can then report back\nreal-time traffic conditions after combining (\u201ccrowdsourc-\ning\u201d) the speed of all such phones on any particular road.9\nSimilarly, phone-location-tracking services are offered as\n\u201csocial\u201d tools, allowing consumers to find (or to avoid)\nothers who enroll in these services. The availability and\nuse of these and other new devices will continue to shape\nthe average person\u2019s expectations about the privacy of his\nor her daily movements.\n                              V\n   In the pre-computer age, the greatest protections of\nprivacy were neither constitutional nor statutory, but\npractical. Traditional surveillance for any extended period\nof time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely under-\ntaken. The surveillance at issue in this case\u2014constant\nmonitoring of the location of a vehicle for four weeks\u2014\nwould have required a large team of agents, multiple\nvehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance.10 Only an investi-\ngation of unusual importance could have justified such an\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See, e.g., The bright side of sitting in traffic: Crowdsourcing road\n\ncongestion data, Google Blog, http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/\nbright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html.\n  10 Even with a radio transmitter like those used in United States v.\n\nKnotts, 460 U. S. 276 (1983), or United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705\n(1984), such long-term surveillance would have been exceptionally\ndemanding. The beepers used in those cases merely \u201cemit[ted] periodic\nsignals that [could] be picked up by a radio receiver.\u201d Knotts, 460 U.S.,\nat 277. The signal had a limited range and could be lost if the police\ndid not stay close enough. Indeed, in Knotts itself, officers lost the\nsignal from the beeper, and only \u201cwith the assistance of a monitoring\ndevice located in a helicopter [was] the approximate location of the\nsignal . . . picked up again about one hour later.\u201d Id., at 278.\n                 Cite as: 565 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nexpenditure of law enforcement resources. Devices like\nthe one used in the present case, however, make long-term\nmonitoring relatively easy and cheap. In circumstances\ninvolving dramatic technological change, the best solution\nto privacy concerns may be legislative. See, e.g., Kerr, 102\nMich. L. Rev., at 805\u2013806. A legislative body is well situ-\nated to gauge changing public attitudes, to draw detailed\nlines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a com-\nprehensive way.\n   To date, however, Congress and most States have not\nenacted statutes regulating the use of GPS tracking tech-\nnology for law enforcement purposes. The best that we\ncan do in this case is to apply existing Fourth Amendment\ndoctrine and to ask whether the use of GPS tracking in a\nparticular case involved a degree of intrusion that a rea-\nsonable person would not have anticipated.\n   Under this approach, relatively short-term monitoring\nof a person\u2019s movements on public streets accords with\nexpectations of privacy that our society has recognized\nas reasonable. See Knotts, 460 U. S., at 281\u2013282. But\nthe use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of\nmost offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For\nsuch offenses, society\u2019s expectation has been that law\nenforcement agents and others would not\u2014and indeed, in\nthe main, simply could not\u2014secretly monitor and cata-\nlogue every single movement of an individual\u2019s car for\na very long period. In this case, for four weeks, law en-\nforcement agents tracked every movement that respond-\nent made in the vehicle he was driving. We need not\nidentify with precision the point at which the tracking of\nthis vehicle became a search, for the line was surely\ncrossed before the 4-week mark. Other cases may present\nmore difficult questions. But where uncertainty exists\nwith respect to whether a certain period of GPS surveil\n14                   UNITED STATES v. JONES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nlance is long enough to constitute a Fourth Amendment\nsearch, the police may always seek a warrant.11 We also\nneed not consider whether prolonged GPS monitoring in\nthe context of investigations involving extraordinary\noffenses would similarly intrude on a constitutionally\nprotected sphere of privacy. In such cases, long-term\ntracking might have been mounted using previously avail-\nable techniques.\n                        *    *     *\n   For these reasons, I conclude that the lengthy monitor-\ning that occurred in this case constituted a search under\nthe Fourth Amendment. I therefore agree with the major-\nity that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 In this case, the agents obtained a warrant, but they did not comply\n\nwith two of the warrant\u2019s restrictions: They did not install the GPS\ndevice within the 10-day period required by the terms of the warrant\nand by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(e)(2)(B)(i), and they did not install the\nGPS device within the District of Columbia, as required by the terms\nof the warrant and by 18 U. S. C. \u00a73117(a) and Rule 41(b)(4). In the\ncourts below the Government did not argue, and has not argued here,\nthat the Fourth Amendment does not impose these precise restrictions\nand that the violation of these restrictions does not demand the sup-\npression of evidence obtained using the tracking device. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gerber, 994 F. 2d 1556, 1559\u20131560 (CA11 1993);\nUnited States v. Burke, 517 F. 2d 377, 386\u2013387 (CA2 1975). Because it\nwas not raised, that question is not before us.\n</pre>",
