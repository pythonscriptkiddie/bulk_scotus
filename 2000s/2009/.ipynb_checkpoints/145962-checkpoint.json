Gant, 556 U. S.\n___ (2009).\n   JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.\n   In Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.

The bar called the police, who found petitioner in his\ncar near the bar and arrested him on warrants for a mov\ning violation and failing to secure a load.

This question may\nbe of some importance because, prior to Gant, an officer\nwho made an arrest pursuant to a warrant had little\nreason to inventory the applicable criminal code at the\nscene of the arrest in order to determine whether a war\nrantless arrest for another offense would also be justified.\n  In this case, however, uncertainty as to whether the\nofficers had probable cause to arrest under \u00a7574.115\nmakes review at this time premature.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe crime of making a terrorist threat if such person communicates a\nthreat to cause an incident or condition involving danger to life. . .[w]ith\ncriminal negligence with regard to the risk of causing the evacuation\n. . . or closure of any portion of a building. . . \u201d It is at least arguable\nthat petitioner was negligent with regard to the possibility that the bar\nwould respond to his threat by closing or evacuating its facility in whole\nor in part.\n",
