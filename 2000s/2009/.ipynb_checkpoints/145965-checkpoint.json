MCNEIL,\n\n     SECRETARY, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF\n\n                CORRECTIONS\n\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES\n     COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n              No. 08\u20137369. Decided March 9, 2009\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   This petition asks us to determine whether the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punish\nments\u201d precludes the execution of a prisoner who has\nspent over 30 years on death row. JUSTICE STEVENS and I\nhave previously written that this is a question that merits\nthe Court\u2019s attention, see, e.g., Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S.\n1045 (1995) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari);\nFoster v. Florida, 537 U. S. 990 (1999) (BREYER, J., dis\nsenting from denial of certiorari); Knight v. Florida, 528\nU. S. 990, 993 (1999) (same), and the delay here is even\nlonger than the delay in those prior cases. Here, peti\ntioner has been on death row for 32 years, well over half\nhis life. For the reasons we have set forth in the past and\nfor many of those added in JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 separate\nstatement, I would grant this petition.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that petitioner cannot now\nchallenge the constitutionality of the delay because much\nof that delay is his own fault\u2014he caused it by choosing to\nchallenge the sentence that the people of Florida deemed\nappropriate. See ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in denial of\ncertiorari). I do not believe that petitioner\u2019s decision to\nexercise his right to seek appellate review of his death\nsentence automatically waives a claim that the Eighth\nAmendment proscribes a delay of more than 30 years. See\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 198 (1976) (joint opinion\nof Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (automatic appeal of\n2                  THOMPSON v. MCNEIL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nall death sentences is \u201can important additional safeguard\nagainst arbitrariness and caprice\u201d). But in any event the\ndelay here resulted in significant part from constitution\nally defective death penalty procedures for which peti\ntioner was not responsible. See Knight, supra, at 993.\n   In particular, the delay was partly caused by the sen\ntencing judge\u2019s failure to allow the presentation and jury\nconsideration of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances,\nan approach which we have unanimously held constitu\ntionally forbidden, see Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S. 393,\n398\u2013399 (1987). As a result of this error, the Florida\nSupreme Court remanded for resentencing. See Thomp\nson v. Dugger, 515 So. 2d 173 (1987).\n   At petitioner\u2019s resentencing, he presented substantial\nmitigating evidence, not previously presented, that sug\ngested that he may be significantly less culpable than his\ncodefendant, who did not receive the death penalty. Peti\ntioner, for example, introduced an affidavit of Barbara\nGarritz, who witnessed the crime for which petitioner was\nsentenced to death.         She described petitioner\u2019s co\ndefendant Rocky Surace as \u201can evil man\u201d and \u201cthe devil,\nhimself\u201d and explained that he \u201cmanipulate[d] people . . .\n[into] follow[ing] his orders.\u201d Tr. 2473 (May 31, 1989). By\ncontrast, she described petitioner as \u201ca big, easy-going\nchild who would do just about anything to please\u201d and who\n\u201cnever seemed to have an idea of his own.\u201d Id., at 2474;\nsee also ibid. (\u201cHe would do just about anything he was\ntold\u201d). She described the relationship between petitioner\nand Rocky as follows: \u201cBill was completely under Rocky\u2019s\nspell. He hung on every word Rocky said and would do\nand say everything Rocky did and said. He was like\nRocky\u2019s dog. Rocky would give an order and Bill would do\nit, no questions asked.\u201d Id., at 2475. With respect to the\nnight in question, she explained that, \u201cEverything Bill did,\nhe did at Rocky\u2019s direction, just like he always did when I\nwas around the two. I saw what happened and I know\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              3\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat Rocky started and finished the whole thing.\u201d Ibid.\n   Garritz\u2019s testimony was consistent with the picture of\npetitioner painted by other witnesses. For example, one of\npetitioner\u2019s teachers testified that while in elementary\nschool petitioner consistently scored in the mid-70\u2019s on IQ\ntests; those scores qualified him for classes for the educa\nble mentally retarded. Id., at 2178 (May 30, 1989). His\nteachers also described him as \u201cslow,\u201d a \u201cfollower\u201d who\nwas \u201calways . . . eager to please.\u201d Id., at 2185, 2186, 2185;\nsee also id., at 2191\u20132192. A psychologist and a psychia\ntrist who examined him both described him as showing\nsigns of brain damage, id., at 2510, 2513, 2516, 2523 (June\n1, 1989); see also id., at 2570\u20132571, 2577, and a psychia\ntrist testified that \u201cthe kind of disorder [petitioner] has,\nhe\u2019s easily led and felt very threatened by the co\ndefendant,\u201d id., at 2564; see also id., at 2602 (\u201cThere is no\ndoubt in the world that this man basically appeared to be\na rather\u2014rather dependent person who tends to follow the\nleader. He is not a leader himself. So, whatever Mr.\nSurace says, he probably goes along with it\u201d). After hear\ning this evidence, the jury recommended a death sentence\nby a vote of 7 to 5.\n   I refer to the evidence only to point out that it is fair, not\nunfair, to take account of the delay the State caused when\nit initially refused to allow Thompson to present it at the\npunishment phase of his trial. I would add that it is the\npunishment, not the gruesome nature of the crime, which\nis at issue. Reasonable jurors might, and did, disagree\nabout the appropriateness of executing Thompson for his\nrole in that crime. The question here, however, is whether\nthe Constitution permits that execution after a delay of 32\nyears\u2014a delay for which the State was in significant part\nresponsible.\n   I believe we should grant the writ to consider that ques\ntion.\n",
