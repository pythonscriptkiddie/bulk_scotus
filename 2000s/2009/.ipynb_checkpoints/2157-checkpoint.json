Decided October 20, 2009 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA\njoins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Every year, close to 13,000 people die in alcohol-related\ncar crashes\u2014roughly one death every 40 minutes. See\nDept. of Transp., Nat. Hwy. Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic\nSafety Facts, 2007 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment\u2014\nAlcohol-Impaired Driving Fatalities 1 (No. 81106, Aug.\n2008). Ordinary citizens are well aware of the dangers\nposed by drunk driving, and they frequently report such\nconduct to the police. A number of States have adopted\nprograms specifically designed to encourage such tips\u2014\nprograms such as the \u201cDrunkbusters Hotline\u201d in New\nMexico and the REDDI program (Report Every Drunk\nDriver Immediately) in force in several States. See Dept.\nof Transp., Nat. Hwy. Traffic Safety Admin., Programs\nAcross the United States That Aid Motorists in the Re\nporting of Impaired Drivers to Law Enforcement (2007).\n   By a 4-to-3 vote, the Virginia Supreme Court below\nadopted a rule that will undermine such efforts to get\ndrunk drivers off the road. The decision below commands\nthat police officers following a driver reported to be drunk\ndo nothing until they see the driver actually do something\nunsafe on the road\u2014by which time it may be too late.\n   Here, a Richmond police officer pulled Joseph Harris\nover after receiving an anonymous tip that Harris was\ndriving while intoxicated. The tip described Harris, his\ncar, and the direction he was traveling in considerable\ndetail. The officer did not personally witness Harris vio\n2                    VIRGINIA v. HARRIS\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nlate any traffic laws. When Harris was pulled over, how\never, he reeked of alcohol, his speech was slurred, he\nalmost fell over in attempting to exit his car, and he failed\nthe sobriety tests the officer administered on the scene.\nHarris was convicted of driving while intoxicated, but the\nVirginia Supreme Court overturned the conviction. It\nconcluded that because the officer had failed to independ\nently verify that Harris was driving dangerously, the stop\nviolated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unrea\nsonable searches and seizures. 276 Va. 689, 696\u2013698, 668\nS. E. 2d 141, 146\u2013147 (2008); see Pet. for Cert. 4 (citing\nrecord).\n  I am not sure that the Fourth Amendment requires such\nindependent corroboration before the police can act, at\nleast in the special context of anonymous tips reporting\ndrunk driving. This is an important question that is not\nanswered by our past decisions, and that has deeply di\nvided federal and state courts. The Court should grant the\npetition for certiorari to answer the question and resolve\nthe conflict.\n  On the one hand, our cases allow police to conduct in\nvestigative stops based on reasonable suspicion, viewed\nunder the totality of the circumstances.

S. 266, 270 (2000),\nhowever, we explained that anonymous tips, in the ab\nsence of additional corroboration, typically lack the \u201cindi\ncia of reliability\u201d needed to justify a stop under the rea\nsonable suspicion standard. In J. L., the Court suppressed\nevidence seized by police after receiving an anonymous tip\nalleging that a young man, wearing a plaid shirt and\nwaiting at a particular bus stop, was carrying a gun. The\nmajority below relied extensively on J. L. in reversing\nHarris\u2019s conviction.\n  But it is not clear that J. L. applies to anonymous tips\nreporting drunk or erratic driving. J.

The Court declined \u201cto speculate about\nthe circumstances under which the danger alleged in an\nanonymous tip might be so great as to justify a search\neven without a showing of reliability.\u201d Id., at 273. It also\nhinted that \u201cin quarters where the reasonable expectation\nof Fourth Amendment privacy is diminished,\u201d it might be\nconstitutionally permissible to \u201cconduct protective\nsearches on the basis of information insufficient to justify\nsearches elsewhere.\u201d Id., at 274.\n   There is no question that drunk driving is a serious and\npotentially deadly crime, as our cases have repeatedly\nemphasized.

Media reports of\nalcohol-related death and mutilation on the Nation\u2019s roads\nare legion\u201d). The imminence of the danger posed by drunk\ndrivers exceeds that at issue in other types of cases. In a\ncase like J. L., the police can often observe the subject of a\ntip and step in before actual harm occurs; with drunk\ndriving, such a wait-and-see approach may prove fatal.\nDrunk driving is always dangerous, as it is occurring.\nThis Court has in fact recognized that the dangers posed\nby drunk drivers are unique, frequently upholding anti\ndrunk-driving policies that might be constitutionally\nproblematic in other, less exigent circumstances.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., Michigan Dept. of State Police v.

It\nwill be difficult for an officer to explain to the family of a\nmotorist killed by that swerve that the police had a tip\nthat the driver of the other car was drunk, but that they\nwere powerless to pull him over, even for a quick check.\n   Maybe the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court below\nwas correct, and the Fourth Amendment bars police from\nacting on anonymous tips of drunk driving unless they can\nverify each tip. If so, then the dangerous consequences of\nthis rule are unavoidable. But the police should have\nevery legitimate tool at their disposal for getting drunk\ndrivers off the road. I would grant certiorari to determine\nif this is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nthen noting that some courts \u201chave reached a different conclusion\u201d);\n\nWells, supra, at 1084, 136 P. 3d, at 814 (\u201csplit of authority\u201d). \n\n</pre>",
