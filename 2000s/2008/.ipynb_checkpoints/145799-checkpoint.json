Apfel, Sharmila Sohoni, Jenner &amp; Block LLP, Washington, DC, for Respondents.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO or Act), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, provides a private right of action for treble damages to \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\" of the Act's criminal prohibitions. \u00a7 1964(c). The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud must plead and prove that it relied on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that a showing of first-party reliance is not required, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2135</span> I</h2>\n<p>Each year the Cook County, Illinois, Treasurer's Office holds a public auction at which it sells tax liens it has acquired on the property of delinquent taxpayers.<sup>[1]</sup> Prospective buyers bid on the liens, but not in cash amounts. Instead, the bids are stated as percentage penalties the property owner must pay the winning bidder in order to clear the lien. The bidder willing to accept the lowest penalty wins the auction and obtains the right to purchase the lien in exchange for paying the outstanding taxes on the property. The property owner may then redeem the property by paying the lienholder the delinquent taxes, plus the penalty established at the auction and an additional 12% penalty on any taxes subsequently paid by the lienholder. If the property owner does not redeem the property within the statutory redemption period, the lienholder may obtain a tax deed for the property, thereby in effect purchasing the property for the value of the delinquent taxes.</p>\n<p>Because property acquired in this manner can often be sold at a significant profit over the amount paid for the lien, the auctions are marked by stiff competition. As a result, most parcels attract multiple bidders willing to accept the lowest penalty permissible\u00970%, that is to say, no penalty at all. (Perhaps to prevent the perverse incentive taxpayers would have if they could redeem their property from a winning bidder for less than the amount of their unpaid taxes, the county does not accept negative bids.) The lower limit of 0% creates a problem: Who wins when the bidding results in a tie? The county's solution is to allocate parcels \"on a rotational basis\" in order to ensure that liens are apportioned fairly among 0% bidders. App. 18.</p>\n<p>But this creates a perverse incentive of its own: Bidders who, in addition to bidding themselves, send agents to bid on their behalf will obtain a disproportionate share of liens. To prevent this kind of manipulation, the county adopted the \"Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule,\" which requires each \"tax buying entity\" to submit bids in its own name and prohibits it from using \"apparent agents, employees, or related entities\" to submit simultaneous bids for the same parcel.<sup>[2]</sup> App. 67. Upon registering for an auction, each bidder must submit a sworn affidavit affirming that it complies with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule.</p>\n<p>Petitioners and respondents are regular participants in Cook County's tax sales. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2136</span> In July 2005, respondents filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, contending that petitioners had fraudulently obtained a disproportionate share of liens by violating the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule at the auctions held from 2002 to 2005. According to respondents, petitioner Sabre Group, LLC, and its principal Barrett Rochman arranged for related firms to bid on Sabre Group's behalf and directed them to file false attestations that they complied with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule. Having thus fraudulently obtained the opportunity to participate in the auction, the related firms collusively bid on the same properties at a 0% rate. As a result, when the county allocated liens on a rotating basis,<sup>[3]</sup> it treated the related firms as independent entities, allowing them collectively to acquire a greater number of liens than would have been granted to a single bidder acting alone. The related firms then purchased the liens and transferred the certificates of purchase to Sabre Group. In this way, respondents allege, petitioners deprived them and other bidders of their fair share of liens and the attendant financial benefits.</p>\n<p>Respondents' complaint contains five counts. Counts I-IV allege that petitioners violated and conspired to violate RICO by conducting their affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity involving numerous acts of mail fraud. In support of their allegations of mail fraud, respondents assert that petitioners \"mailed or caused to be mailed hundreds of mailings in furtherance of the scheme,\" App. 49, when they sent property owners various notices required by Illinois law. Count V alleges a state-law claim of tortious interference with prospective business advantage.</p>\n<p>On petitioners' motion, the District Court dismissed respondents' RICO claims for lack of standing. It observed that \"[o]nly [respondents] and other competing buyers, as opposed to the Treasurer or the property owners, would suffer a financial loss from a scheme to violate the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. But it concluded that respondents \"are not in the class of individuals protected by the mail fraud statute, and therefore are not within the `zone of interests' that the RICO statute protects,\" because they \"were not recipients of the alleged misrepresentations and, at best were indirect victims of the alleged fraud.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18a. The District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents' tortious-interference claim and dismissed it without prejudice.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It first concluded that \"[s]tanding is not a problem in this suit\" because plaintiffs suffered a \"real injury\" when they lost the valuable chance to acquire more liens, and because \"that injury can be redressed by damages.\" 477 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2137</span> 928, 930 (2007). The Court of Appeals next concluded that respondents had sufficiently alleged proximate cause under <i>Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> 503 U.S. 258, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992), and <i>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp.,</i> 547 U.S. 451, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006), because they (along with other losing bidders) were \"immediately injured\" by petitioners' scheme. 477 F.3d, at 930-932. Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' argument that respondents are not entitled to relief under RICO because they did not receive, and therefore did not rely on, any false statements: \"A scheme that injures D by making false statements through the mail to E is mail fraud, and actionable by D through RICO if the injury is not derivative of someone else's.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 932.</p>\n<p>With respect to this last holding, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that courts have taken conflicting views. By its count, \"[t]hree other circuits that have considered this question agree . . . that the direct <i>victim</i> may recover through RICO whether or not it is the direct <i>recipient</i> of the false statements,\" <i>ibid.</i> (citing <i>Mid Atlantic Telecom, Inc. v. Long Distance Servs., Inc.,</i> 18 F.3d 260, 263-264 (C.A.4 1994); <i>Systems Management, Inc. v. Loiselle,</i> 303 F.3d 100, 103-104 (C.A.1 2002); <i>Ideal Steel Supply Corp. v. Anza,</i> 373 F.3d 251, 263 (C.A.2 2004)), whereas two Circuits hold that the plaintiff must show that it in fact relied on the defendant's misrepresentations, 477 F.3d, at 932 (citing <i>VanDenBroeck v. CommonPoint Mortgage Co.,</i> 210 F.3d 696, 701 (C.A.6 2000); <i>Sikes v. Teleline, Inc.,</i> 281 F.3d 1350, 1360-1361 (C.A.11 2002)). Compare also <i>Sandwich Chef of Texas, Inc. v. Reliance Nat'l Indemnity Ins. Co.,</i> 319 F.3d 205, 223 (C.A.5 2003) (recognizing \"a narrow exception to the requirement that the plaintiff prove direct reliance on the defendant's fraudulent predicate act . . . when the plaintiff can demonstrate injury as a direct and contemporaneous result of a fraud committed against a third party\"), with <i>Appletree Square I, L.P. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.,</i> 29 F.3d 1283, 1286-1287 (C.A.8 1994) (requiring the plaintiff to show that it detrimentally relied on the defendant's misrepresentations).</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 829, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008), to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals on \"the substantial question,\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 461, 126 S.Ct. 1991, whether first-party reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin by setting forth the applicable statutory provisions. RICO's private right of action is contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), which provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\" Section 1962 contains RICO's criminal prohibitions. Pertinent here is \u00a7 1962(c), which makes it \"unlawful for any person employed by or associated with\" an enterprise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2138</span> engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce \"to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" The term \"racketeering activity\" is defined to include a host of so-called predicate acts, including \"any act which is indictable under. . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud).\" \u00a7 1961(1)(B).</p>\n<p>The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of action for treble damages to any person injured in his business or property by reason of the conduct of a qualifying enterprise's affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a person, \"having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\" uses the mail \"for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.\" \u00a7 1341. The gravamen of the offense is the scheme to defraud, and any \"mailing that is incident to an essential part of the scheme satisfies the mailing element,\" <i>Schmuck v. United States,</i> 489 U.S. 705, 712, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), even if the mailing itself \"contain[s] no false information,\" <i>id.,</i> at 715, 109 S.Ct. 1443.</p>\n<p>Once the relationship among these statutory provisions is understood, respondents' theory of the case is straightforward. They allege that petitioners devised a scheme to defraud when they agreed to submit false attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule to the county. In furtherance of this scheme, petitioners used the mail on numerous occasions to send the requisite notices to property owners. Each of these mailings was an \"act which is indictable\" as mail fraud, and together they constituted a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" By conducting the affairs of their enterprise through this pattern of racketeering activity, petitioners violated \u00a7 1962(c). As a result, respondents lost the opportunity to acquire valuable liens. Accordingly, respondents were injured in their business or property by reason of petitioners' violation of \u00a7 1962(c), and RICO's plain terms give them a private right of action for treble damages.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue, however, that because the alleged pattern of racketeering activity consisted of acts of mail fraud, respondents must show that they relied on petitioners' fraudulent misrepresentations. This they cannot do, because the alleged misrepresentations\u0097petitioners' attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule\u0097were made to the county, not respondents. The <i>county</i> may well have relied on petitioners' misrepresentations when it permitted them to participate in the auction, but <i>respondents,</i> never having received the misrepresentations, could not have done so. Indeed, respondents do not even allege that they relied on petitioners' false attestations. Thus, petitioners submit, they fail to state a claim under RICO.</p>\n<p>If petitioners' proposed requirement of first-party reliance seems to come out of nowhere, there is a reason: Nothing on the face of the relevant statutory provisions imposes such a requirement. Using the mail to execute or attempt to execute a scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud, and hence a predicate act of racketeering under RICO, even if no one relied on any misrepresentation. See <i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 24-25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (\"The common-law requiremen[t] of `justifiable reliance'. . . plainly ha[s] no place in the [mail, wire, or bank] fraud statutes\"). And one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying enterprise through a pattern of such acts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2139</span> without anyone relying on a fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p>It thus seems plain\u0097and indeed petitioners do not dispute\u0097that no showing of reliance is required to establish that a person has violated \u00a7 1962(c) by conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of acts of mail fraud. See <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 476, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Because an individual can commit an indictable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of \u00a7 1962, without proof of reliance\"). If reliance is required, then, it must be by virtue of \u00a7 1964(c), which provides the right of action. But it is difficult to derive a first-party reliance requirement from \u00a7 1964(c), which states simply that \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962\" may sue for treble damages. The statute provides a right of action to \"[a]ny person\" injured by the violation, suggesting a breadth of coverage not easily reconciled with an implicit requirement that the plaintiff show reliance in addition to injury in his business or property.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a person can be injured \"by reason of\" a pattern of mail fraud even if he has not relied on any misrepresentations. This is a case in point. Accepting their allegations as true, respondents clearly were injured by petitioners' scheme: As a result of petitioners' fraud, respondents lost valuable liens they otherwise would have been awarded. And this is true even though they did not rely on petitioners' false attestations of compliance with the county's rules. Or, to take another example, suppose an enterprise that wants to get rid of rival businesses mails misrepresentations about them to their customers and suppliers, but not to the rivals themselves. If the rival businesses lose money as a result of the misrepresentations, it would certainly seem that they were injured in their business \"by reason of\" a pattern of mail fraud, even though they never received, and therefore never relied on, the fraudulent mailings. Yet petitioners concede that, on their reading of \u00a7 1964(c), the rival businesses would have no cause of action under RICO, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, even though they were the primary and intended victims of the scheme to defraud.</p>\n<p>Lacking textual support for this counterintuitive position, petitioners rely instead on a combination of common-law rules and policy arguments in an effort to show that Congress should be presumed to have made first-party reliance an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud. None of petitioners' arguments persuades us to read a first-party reliance requirement into a statute that by its terms suggests none.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioners first argue that RICO should be read to incorporate a first-party reliance requirement in fraud cases \"under the rule that Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\" <i>Neder, supra,</i> at 23, 119 S.Ct. 1827. It has long been settled, they contend, that only the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation may recover for common-law fraud, and that he may do so \"if, but only if . . . he relies on the misrepresentation in acting or refraining from action.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 537 (1977). Given this background rule of common law, petitioners maintain, Congress should be presumed to have adopted a first-party reliance requirement when it created a civil cause of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2140</span> action under RICO for victims of mail fraud.</p>\n<p>In support of this argument, petitioners point to our decision in <i>Beck v. Prupis,</i> 529 U.S. 494, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000). There, we considered the scope of RICO's private right of action for violations of \u00a7 1962(d), which makes it \"unlawful for any person to conspire to violate\" RICO's criminal prohibitions. The question presented was \"whether a person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy may assert a civil RICO conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d) even if the overt act does not constitute `racketeering activity.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 500, 120 S.Ct. 1608. Answering this question in the negative, we held that \"injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d).\" <i>Id.,</i> at 505, 120 S.Ct. 1608 (citation omitted). In so doing, we \"turn[ed] to the well-established common law of civil conspiracy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 500, 120 S.Ct. 1608. Because it was \"widely accepted\" by the time of RICO's enactment \"that a plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracy only if he had been injured by an act that was itself tortious,\" <i>id.,</i> at 501, 120 S.Ct. 1608, we presumed \"that when Congress established in RICO a civil cause of action for a person `injured . . . by reason of' a `conspir[acy],' it meant to adopt these well-established common-law civil conspiracy principles.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 504, 120 S.Ct. 1608 (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 1964(c), 1962(d); alterations in original). We specifically declined to rely on the law of criminal conspiracy, relying instead on the law of civil conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We have turned to the common law of criminal conspiracy to define what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962(d), see <i>Salinas v. United States,</i> 522 U.S. 52, 63-65[, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352] (1997), a mere violation being all that is necessary for criminal liability. This case, however, does not present simply the question of what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962(d), but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation. In other words, our task is to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 1964(c) and 1962(d) in conjunction, rather than \u00a7 1962(d) standing alone. The obvious source in the common law for the combined meaning of these provisions is the law of civil conspiracy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 501, n. 6, 120 S.Ct. 1608.</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioners argue that, as in <i>Beck,</i> we should look to the common-law meaning of civil fraud in order to give content to the civil cause of action \u00a7 1964(c) provides for private injury by reason of a violation of \u00a7 1962(c) based on a pattern of mail fraud. The analogy to <i>Beck,</i> however, is misplaced. The critical difference between <i>Beck</i> and this case is that in \u00a7 1962(d) Congress used a term\u0097\"conspir[acy]\"\u0097 that had a settled common-law meaning, whereas Congress included no such term in \u00a7 1962(c). Section 1962(c) does not use the term \"fraud\"; nor does the operative language of \u00a7 1961(1)(B), which defines \"racketeering activity\" to include \"any act which is indictable under . . . section 1341.\" And the indictable act under \u00a7 1341 is not the fraudulent misrepresentation, but rather the use of the mails with the purpose of executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud. In short, the key term in \u00a7 1962(c)\u0097\"racketeering activity\"\u0097is a <i>defined</i> term, and Congress defined the predicate act not as fraud <i>simpliciter,</i> but mail fraud\u0097a statutory offense unknown to the common law. In these circumstances, the presumption that Congress intends to adopt the settled meaning of common-law terms has little pull. Cf. <i>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> 552 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2141</span> ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 761, 773, 169 L.Ed.2d 627 (2008) (rejecting the argument that \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), incorporates common-law fraud). There is simply no \"reason to believe that Congress would have defined `racketeering activity' to include acts indictable under the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only when those acts would have been actionable under the common law.\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 477-478, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Nor does it help petitioners' cause that here, as in <i>Beck,</i> the question is not simply \"what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962[(c)], but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation.\" 529 U.S., at 501, n. 6, 120 S.Ct. 1608. To be sure, <i>Beck</i> held that a plaintiff cannot state a civil claim for conspiracy under \u00a7 1964(c) merely by showing a violation of \u00a7 1962(d) and a resulting injury. But in so doing, <i>Beck</i> relied not only on the fact that the term \"conspiracy\" had a settled common-law meaning, but also on the well-established common-law understanding of what it means to be injured by a conspiracy for purposes of bringing a civil claim for damages. See <i>id.,</i> at 501-504, 120 S.Ct. 1608. No comparable understanding exists with respect to injury caused by an enterprise conducting its affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. And even the common-law understanding of injury caused by fraud does not support petitioners' argument. As discussed <i>infra,</i> at 2142-2143, the common law has long recognized that plaintiffs can recover in a variety of circumstances where, as here, their injuries result directly from the defendant's fraudulent misrepresentations to a third party.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we reject petitioners' contention that the \"common-law meaning\" rule dictates that reliance by the plaintiff is an element of a civil RICO claim predicated on a violation of the mail fraud statute. Congress chose to make mail fraud, not common-law fraud, the predicate act for a RICO violation. And \"the mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim.\" <i>Anza, supra,</i> at 476, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioners next argue that even if Congress did not make first-party reliance an element of a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud, a plaintiff who brings such a claim must show that it relied on the defendant's misrepresentations in order to establish the requisite element of causation. In <i>Holmes,</i> we recognized that \u00a7 1964(c)'s \"language can, of course, be read to mean that a plaintiff is injured `by reason of a RICO violation, and therefore may recover, simply on showing that the defendant violated \u00a7 1962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant's violation was a `but for' cause of plaintiff's injury.\" 503 U.S., at 265-266, 112 S.Ct. 1311 (footnote omitted). We nonetheless held that not \"all factually injured plaintiffs\" may recover under \u00a7 1964(c). <i>Id.,</i> at 266, 112 S.Ct. 1311. Because Congress modeled \u00a7 1964(c) on other provisions that had been interpreted to \"requir[e] a showing that the defendant's violation not only was a `but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well,\" we concluded that \u00a7 1964(c) likewise requires the plaintiff to establish proximate cause in order to show injury \"by reason of\" a RICO violation. <i>Id.,</i> at 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2142</span> Proximate cause, we explained, is a flexible concept that does not lend itself to \"`a black-letter rule that will dictate the result in every case.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 272, n. 20, 112 S.Ct. 1311 (quoting <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters,</i> 459 U.S. 519, 536, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983)). Instead, we \"use[d] `proximate cause' to label generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts,\" <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S., at 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, with a particular emphasis on the \"demand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,\" <i>ibid.;</i> see also <i>Anza, supra,</i> at 461, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (\"When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries\"). The direct-relation requirement avoids the difficulties associated with attempting \"to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors,\" <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S., at 269, 112 S.Ct. 1311; prevents courts from having \"to adopt complicated rules of apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries,\" <i>ibid.;</i> and recognizes the fact that \"directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely,\" <i>id.,</i> at 269-270, 112 S.Ct. 1311.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Pointing to our reliance on common-law proximate-causation principles in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> petitioners argue that \"[u]nder well-settled common-law principles, proximate cause is established for fraud claims only where the plaintiff can demonstrate that he relied on the misrepresentation.\" Brief for Petitioners 28. In support of this argument, petitioners cite Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 548A, which provides that \"[a] fraudulent misrepresentation is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from action or inaction in reliance upon it if, but only if, the loss might reasonably be expected to result from the reliance.\" Thus, petitioners conclude, \"a plaintiff asserting a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud cannot satisfy the proximate cause requirement unless he can establish that his injuries resulted from his reliance on the defendant's fraudulent misrepresentation.\" Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p>Petitioners' argument is twice flawed. First, as explained above, the predicate act here is not common-law fraud, but mail fraud. Having rejected petitioners' argument that reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud, we see no reason to let that argument in through the back door by holding that the proximate-cause analysis under RICO must precisely track the proximate-cause analysis of a common-law fraud claim. \"Reliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it `is a specialized condition that happens to have grown up with common law fraud.'\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 477, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2143</span> in part) (quoting <i>Systems Management,</i> 303 F.3d, at 104). That \"specialized condition,\" whether characterized as an element of the claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, simply has no place in a remedial scheme keyed to the commission of mail fraud, a statutory offense that is distinct from common-law fraud and that does not require proof of reliance.</p>\n<p>Second, while it may be that first-party reliance is an element of a common-law fraud claim, there is no general common-law principle holding that a fraudulent misrepresentation can cause legal injury only to those who rely on it. The Restatement provision cited by petitioners certainly does not support that proposition. It provides only that the plaintiff's loss must be a foreseeable result of <i>someone's</i> reliance on the misrepresentation.<sup>[6]</sup> It does not say that only those who rely on the misrepresentation can suffer a legally cognizable injury. And any such notion would be contradicted by the long line of cases in which courts have permitted a plaintiff directly injured by a fraudulent misrepresentation to recover even though it was a third party, and not the plaintiff, who relied on the defendant's misrepresentation.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, so well established is the defendant's liability in such circumstances that the Restatement (Second) of Torts sets forth as a \"[g]eneral [p]rinciple\" that \"[o]ne who intentionally causes injury to another is subject to liability to the other for that injury, if his conduct is generally culpable and not justifiable under the circumstances.\" \u00a7 870. As an illustration, the Restatement provides the example of a defendant who \"seeks to promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to <i>or about</i> the plaintiff or his product.\" <i>Id.,</i> Comment <i>h</i> (emphasis added). And the Restatement specifically recognizes \"a cause of action\" in favor of the injured party where the defendant \"defrauds another for the purpose of causing pecuniary harm to a third person.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 435A, Comment <i>a.</i> Petitioners' contention that proximate cause has traditionally incorporated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2144</span> a first-party reliance requirement for claims based on fraud cannot be reconciled with these authorities.</p>\n<p>Nor is first-party reliance necessary to ensure that there is a sufficiently direct relationship between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the plaintiff's injury to satisfy the proximate-cause principles articulated in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza.</i> Again, this is a case in point. Respondents' alleged injury\u0097the loss of valuable liens\u0097is the direct result of petitioners' fraud. It was a foreseeable and natural consequence of petitioners' scheme to obtain more liens for themselves that other bidders would obtain fewer liens. And here, unlike in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> there are no independent factors that account for respondents' injury, there is no risk of duplicative recoveries by plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violation, and no more immediate victim is better situated to sue. Indeed, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that respondents and other losing bidders were the <i>only</i> parties injured by petitioners' misrepresentations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a; 477 F.3d, at 931. Petitioners quibble with that conclusion, asserting that the county would be injured too if the taint of fraud deterred potential bidders from participating in the auction. But that eventuality, in contrast to respondents' direct financial injury, seems speculative and remote.</p>\n<p>Of course, none of this is to say that a RICO plaintiff who alleges injury \"by reason of\" a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that <i>someone</i> relied on the defendant's misrepresentations. Cf. <i>Field v. Mans,</i> 516 U.S. 59, 66, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (\"No one, of course, doubts that some degree of reliance is required to satisfy the element of causation inherent in the phrase `obtained by'\" in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), which prohibits the discharge of debts for money or property \"obtained by\" fraud). In most cases, the plaintiff will not be able to establish even but-for causation if no one relied on the misrepresentation. If, for example, the county had not accepted petitioners' false attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule, and as a result had not permitted petitioners to participate in the auction, respondents' injury would never have materialized. In addition, the complete absence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establishing proximate cause. Thus, for example, if the county knew petitioners' attestations were false but nonetheless permitted them to participate in the auction, then arguably the county's actions would constitute an intervening cause breaking the chain of causation between petitioners' misrepresentations and respondents' injury.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it may well be that a RICO plaintiff alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at least third-party reliance in order to prove causation. \"But the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff's cause of action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action.\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 478, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nor does it transform first-party reliance into an indispensable requisite of proximate causation. Proof that the plaintiff relied on the defendant's misrepresentations may in some cases be sufficient to establish proximate cause, but there is no sound reason to conclude that such proof is always necessary. By the same token, the absence of first-party reliance may in some cases tend to show that an injury was not sufficiently direct to satisfy \u00a7 1964(c)'s proximate-cause requirement, but it is not in and of itself dispositive. A contrary holding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2145</span> would ignore <i>Holmes</i>' instruction that proximate cause is generally not amenable to bright-line rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As a last resort, petitioners contend that we should interpret RICO to require first-party reliance for fraud-based claims in order to avoid the \"over-federalization\" of traditional state-law claims. In petitioners' view, respondents' claim is essentially one for tortious interference with prospective business advantage, as evidenced by Count V of their complaint. Such claims have traditionally been handled under state law, and petitioners see no reason why Congress would have wanted to supplement traditional state-law remedies with a federal cause of action, complete with treble damages and attorney's fees, in a statute designed primarily to combat organized crime. See <i>Anza, supra,</i> at 471-475, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>Beck,</i> 529 U.S., at 496-497, 120 S.Ct. 1608. A first-party reliance requirement, they say, is necessary \"to prevent garden-variety disputes between local competitors (such as this case) from being converted into federal racketeering actions.\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 3.</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of petitioners' arguments as a policy matter, we are not at liberty to rewrite RICO to reflect their\u0097 or our\u0097views of good policy. We have repeatedly refused to adopt narrowing constructions of RICO in order to make it conform to a preconceived notion of what Congress intended to proscribe. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler,</i> 510 U.S. 249, 252, 114 S.Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994) (rejecting the argument that \"RICO requires proof that either the racketeering enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering were motivated by an economic purpose\"); <i>H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,</i> 492 U.S. 229, 244, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (rejecting \"the argument for reading an organized crime limitation into RICO's pattern concept\"); <i>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co.,</i> 473 U.S. 479, 481, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985) (rejecting the view that RICO provides a private right of action \"only against defendants who had been convicted on criminal charges, and only where there had occurred a `racketeering injury'\").</p>\n<p>We see no reason to change course here. RICO's text provides no basis for imposing a first-party reliance requirement. If the absence of such a requirement leads to the undue proliferation of RICO suits, the \"correction must lie with Congress.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 499, 105 S.Ct. 3275. \"It is not for the judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations where Congress has provided it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 499-500, 105 S.Ct. 3275.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because this case arises from the District Court's grant of petitioners' motion to dismiss, we \"accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in [respondents'] complaint.\" <i>Erickson v. Pardus,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule provides that \"one tax buying entity (principal) may not have its/his/her/their actual or apparent agents, employees, or related entities, directly or indirectly register under multiple registrations for the <i>intended or perceived</i> purpose of having more than one person bidding at the tax sale at the same time for the <i>intended or perceived</i> purpose of increasing the principal's likelihood of obtaining a successful bid on a parcel.\" App. 67. The rule defines \"Related Bidding Entity\" as \"any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, business organization, or other entity that has a shareholder, partner, principal, officer, general partner or other person or entity having an ownership interest in common with, or contractual relationship with, any other registrant.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It further provides that \"[t]he determination of whether registered entities are related, so as to prevent the entities from bidding at the same time, is in the <i>sole and exclusive discretion</i> of the Cook County Treasurer or her designated representatives.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Respondents' complaint does not elaborate on the county's rotational system. The Court of Appeals described it as follows: \"If X bids 0% on ten parcels, and each parcel attracts five bids at that penalty rate, then the County awards X two of the ten parcels. Winners share according to the ratio of their bids to other identical bids.\" 477 F.3d 928, 929 (C.A.7 2007). Petitioners object that this description is not supported by the record and inappropriately \"inject[s] into the case an element of mathematical certainty that is missing from the complaint itself.\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 20. While a precise understanding of the county's system may be necessary to calculate respondents' damages, nothing in our disposition turns on this issue. For present purposes, it suffices that respondents allege they \"suffered the loss of property related to the liens they would have been able to acquire, and the profits flowing therefrom, had [petitioners] not implemented their scheme and acquired liens in excess of their appropriate share through their violation of the County Rule.\" App. 50.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court considered a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud in its recent decision in <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S. 451, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720. There the Court held that proximate cause is a condition of recovery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). The Court did not address the question whether reliance by the plaintiff is a required element of a RICO claim, the matter now before us. Cf. 547 U.S., at 475-478, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (reaching the question and concluding that reliance is not an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud).</p>\n<p>[5]  Applying these principles in <i>Holmes,</i> the Court held that the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) could not recover for injuries caused by a stock-manipulation scheme that prevented two broker-dealers from meeting obligations to their customers, thereby triggering SIPC's duty to reimburse the customers. 503 U.S., at 270-274, 112 S.Ct. 1311. And in <i>Anza,</i> the Court applied the principles of <i>Holmes</i> to preclude a company from recovering profits it allegedly lost when a rival business was able to lower its prices because it failed to charge the requisite sales tax on cash sales. 547 U.S., at 456-461, 126 S.Ct. 1991.</p>\n<p>[6]  In addition to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 548A (1977), petitioners cite Comment <i>a</i> to that section, which provides that \"[c]ausation, in relation to losses incurred by reason of a misrepresentation, is a matter of the recipient's reliance in fact upon the misrepresentation in taking some action or in refraining from it.\" Like \u00a7 548A itself, however, the comment does not support petitioners' argument. Of course, a misrepresentation can cause harm only if a recipient of the misrepresentation relies on it. But that does not mean that the only injuries proximately caused by the misrepresentation are those suffered by the recipient.</p>\n<p>[7]  Such cases include <i>Rice v. Manley,</i> 66 N.Y. 82 (1876) (permitting plaintiffs who had arranged to buy a large quantity of cheese to recover against a defendant who induced the vendor to sell him the cheese by falsely representing to the vendor that plaintiffs no longer wished to purchase it); and <i>Gregory v. Brooks,</i> 35 Conn. 437 (1868) (permitting plaintiff wharf owner to recover against a defendant who, in order to deprive plaintiff of business, misrepresented himself to be a superintendent of wharves and ordered a vessel unloading at plaintiff's wharf to leave); see also Brief for Respondents 26-29 (collecting cases).\n</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that these cases are irrelevant because they would be treated today as specialized torts, such as wrongful interference with contractual relations, rather than as common-law fraud. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767, Comment <i>c</i> (recognizing that \"one [may be] liable to another for intentional interference with economic relations by inducing a third person by fraudulent misrepresentation not to do business with the other\"). But petitioners miss the point. The cases are not cited as evidence that common-law fraud can be established without showing first-party reliance. Rather, they\u0097along with the Restatement's recognition of specialized torts based on third-party reliance\u0097show that a fraudulent misrepresentation can proximately cause actionable injury even to those who do not rely on the misrepresentation.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued April 14, 2008\u2014Decided June 9, 2008\nEach year the Cook County Treasurer\u2019s Office holds a public auction to\n  sell its tax liens on delinquent taxpayers\u2019 property. To prevent any\n  one buyer from obtaining a disproportionate share of the liens, the\n  county adopted the \u201cSingle, Simultaneous Bidder Rule\u201d (Rule), which\n  requires each buyer to submit bids in its own name, prohibits a buyer\n  from using \u201capparent agents, employees, or related entities\u201d to sub-\n  mit simultaneous bids for the same parcel, and requires a registered\n  bidder to submit a sworn affidavit affirming its compliance with the\n  Rule. Petitioners and respondents regularly participate in the tax\n  sales. Respondents filed suit, alleging that petitioners fraudulently\n  obtained a disproportionate share of liens by filing false compliance\n  attestations. As relevant here, they claim that petitioners violated\n  and conspired to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Or-\n  ganizations Act (RICO) through a pattern of racketeering activity in-\n  volving mail fraud, which occurred when petitioners sent property\n  owners various notices required by Illinois law. The District Court\n  dismissed the RICO claims for lack of standing, finding that respon-\n  dents were not protected by the mail fraud statute because they did\n  not receive the alleged misrepresentations. Reversing, the Seventh\n  Circuit based standing on the injury respondents suffered when they\n  lost the chance to obtain more liens, and found that respondents had\n  sufficiently alleged proximate cause because they were immediately\n  injured by petitioners\u2019 scheme.

Pp. 6\u201321.\n       (a) In 18 U. S. C. \u00a71964(c), RICO provides a private right of action\n    for treble damages to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or prop-\n    erty by reason of a violation,\u201d as pertinent here, of \u00a71962(c), which\n    makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or associated with\u201d a\n    qualifying enterprise \u201cto conduct or participate . . . in the conduct of\n    such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,\u201d\n    including \u201cmail fraud,\u201d \u00a71961(1)(B). Mail fraud, in turn, occurs\n    whenever a person, \u201chaving devised or intending to devise any\n    scheme or artifice to defraud,\u201d uses the mail \u201cfor the purpose of exe-\n    cuting such scheme or artifice.\u201d \u00a71341. The gravamen of the offense\n    is the scheme to defraud, and any \u201c \u2018mailing . . . incident to an essen-\n    tial part of the scheme\u2019 . . . satisfies the mailing element,\u201d Schmuck v.\n    United States, 489 U. S. 705, 712, even if the mailing \u201ccontain[s] no\n    false information,\u201d id., at 715. Once the relationship among these\n    statutory provisions is understood, respondents\u2019 theory of the case is\n    straightforward. Petitioners nonetheless argue that because the al-\n    leged pattern of racketeering activity is predicated on mail fraud, re-\n    spondents must show that they relied on petitioners\u2019 fraudulent mis-\n    representations,      which       they     cannot    do    because   the\n    misrepresentations were made to the county. Nothing on the stat-\n    ute\u2019s face imposes such a requirement. Using the mail to execute or\n    attempt to execute a scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud,\n    and hence a predicate racketeering act under RICO, even if no one re-\n    lied on any misrepresentation, see Neder v. United States, 527 U. S.\n    1, 24\u201325; and one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying enterprise\n    through a pattern of such acts without anyone relying on a fraudu-\n    lent misrepresentation. Thus, no reliance showing is required to es-\n    tablish that a person has violated \u00a71962(c) by conducting an enter-\n    prise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity predicated\n    on mail fraud. Nor can a first-party reliance requirement be derived\n    from \u00a71964(c), which, by providing a right of action to \u201c[a]ny person\u201d\n    injured by a violation of \u00a71962, suggests a breadth of coverage not\n    easily reconciled with an implicit first-party reliance requirement.\n    Moreover, a person can be injured \u201cby reason of\u201d a pattern of mail\n    fraud even if he has not relied on any misrepresentations. For exam-\n    ple, accepting respondents\u2019 allegations as true, they were harmed by\n    petitioners\u2019 scheme when they lost valuable liens they otherwise\n    would have been awarded.

PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspective buyers bid on the liens, but not in cash amounts.\nInstead, the bids are stated as percentage penalties the\nproperty owner must pay the winning bidder in order to\nclear the lien. The bidder willing to accept the lowest\npenalty wins the auction and obtains the right to purchase\nthe lien in exchange for paying the outstanding taxes on\nthe property. The property owner may then redeem the\nproperty by paying the lienholder the delinquent taxes,\nplus the penalty established at the auction and an addi-\ntional 12% penalty on any taxes subsequently paid by the\nlienholder. If the property owner does not redeem the\nproperty within the statutory redemption period, the\nlienholder may obtain a tax deed for the property, thereby\nin effect purchasing the property for the value of the de-\nlinquent taxes.\n   Because property acquired in this manner can often be\nsold at a significant profit over the amount paid for the\nlien, the auctions are marked by stiff competition. As a\nresult, most parcels attract multiple bidders willing to\naccept the lowest penalty permissible\u20140%, that is to say,\nno penalty at all. (Perhaps to prevent the perverse incen-\ntive taxpayers would have if they could redeem their\nproperty from a winning bidder for less than the amount\nof their unpaid taxes, the county does not accept negative\nbids.) The lower limit of 0% creates a problem: Who wins\nwhen the bidding results in a tie? The county\u2019s solution is\nto allocate parcels \u201con a rotational basis\u201d in order to en-\nsure that liens are apportioned fairly among 0% bidders.\nApp. 18.\n   But this creates a perverse incentive of its own: Bidders\nwho, in addition to bidding themselves, send agents to bid\non their behalf will obtain a disproportionate share of\nliens. To prevent this kind of manipulation, the county\nadopted the \u201cSingle, Simultaneous Bidder Rule,\u201d which\nrequires each \u201ctax buying entity\u201d to submit bids in its own\nname and prohibits it from using \u201capparent agents, em-\n                     Cite as: 553 U.

Upon registering for an\nauction, each bidder must submit a sworn affidavit affirm-\ning that it complies with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder\nRule.\n   Petitioners and respondents are regular participants in\nCook County\u2019s tax sales. In July 2005, respondents filed a\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of Illinois, contending that petitioners\nhad fraudulently obtained a disproportionate share of\nliens by violating the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule at\nthe auctions held from 2002 to 2005. According to respon-\ndents, petitioner Sabre Group, LLC, and its principal\nBarrett Rochman arranged for related firms to bid on\nSabre Group\u2019s behalf and directed them to file false attes-\ntations that they complied with the Single, Simultaneous\nBidder Rule. Having thus fraudulently obtained the\nopportunity to participate in the auction, the related firms\ncollusively bid on the same properties at a 0% rate. As a\nresult, when the county allocated liens on a rotating ba-\nsis,3 it treated the related firms as independent entities,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule provides that \u201cone tax buying\n\nentity (principal) may not have its/his/her/their actual or apparent\nagents, employees, or related entities, directly or indirectly register\nunder multiple registrations for the intended or perceived purpose of\nhaving more than one person bidding at the tax sale at the same time\nfor the intended or perceived purpose of increasing the principal\u2019s\nlikelihood of obtaining a successful bid on a parcel.\u201d App. 67. The rule\ndefines \u201cRelated Bidding Entity\u201d as \u201cany individual, corporation,\npartnership, joint venture, limited liability company, business organi-\nzation, or other entity that has a shareholder, partner, principal,\nofficer, general partner or other person or entity having an ownership\ninterest in common with, or contractual relationship with, any other\nregistrant.\u201d Ibid. It further provides that \u201c[t]he determination of\nwhether registered entities are related, so as to prevent the entities\nfrom bidding at the same time, is in the sole and exclusive discretion of\nthe Cook County Treasurer or her designated representatives.\u201d Ibid.\n   3 Respondents\u2019 complaint does not elaborate on the county\u2019s rotational\n4         BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nallowing them collectively to acquire a greater number of\nliens than would have been granted to a single bidder\nacting alone. The related firms then purchased the liens\nand transferred the certificates of purchase to Sabre\nGroup. In this way, respondents allege, petitioners de-\nprived them and other bidders of their fair share of liens\nand the attendant financial benefits.\n   Respondents\u2019 complaint contains five counts. Counts I\u2013\nIV allege that petitioners violated and conspired to violate\nRICO by conducting their affairs through a pattern of\nracketeering activity involving numerous acts of mail\nfraud. In support of their allegations of mail fraud, re-\nspondents assert that petitioners \u201cmailed or caused to be\nmailed hundreds of mailings in furtherance of the\nscheme,\u201d App. 49, when they sent property owners various\nnotices required by Illinois law. Count V alleges a state-\nlaw claim of tortious interference with prospective busi-\nness advantage.\n   On petitioners\u2019 motion, the District Court dismissed\nrespondents\u2019 RICO claims for lack of standing. It observed\nthat \u201c[o]nly [respondents] and other competing buyers, as\nopposed to the Treasurer or the property owners, would\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsystem. The Court of Appeals described it as follows: \u201cIf X bids 0% on\nten parcels, and each parcel attracts five bids at that penalty rate, then\nthe County awards X two of the ten parcels. Winners share according\nto the ratio of their bids to other identical bids.\u201d 477 F. 3d 928, 929\n(CA7 2007). Petitioners object that this description is not supported by\nthe record and inappropriately \u201cinject[s] into the case an element of\nmathematical certainty that is missing from the complaint itself.\u201d\nReply Brief for Petitioners 20. While a precise understanding of the\ncounty\u2019s system may be necessary to calculate respondents\u2019 damages,\nnothing in our disposition turns on this issue. For present purposes, it\nsuffices that respondents allege they \u201csuffered the loss of property\nrelated to the liens they would have been able to acquire, and the\nprofits flowing therefrom, had [petitioners] not implemented their\nscheme and acquired liens in excess of their appropriate share through\ntheir violation of the County Rule.\u201d App. 50.\n                 Cite as: 553 U.

The District\nCourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nrespondents\u2019 tortious-interference claim and dismissed it\nwithout prejudice.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.\nIt first concluded that \u201c[s]tanding is not a problem in this\nsuit\u201d because plaintiffs suffered a \u201creal injury\u201d when they\nlost the valuable chance to acquire more liens, and be-\ncause \u201cthat injury can be redressed by damages.\u201d 477\nF. 3d 928, 930 (2007). The Court of Appeals next con-\ncluded that respondents had sufficiently alleged proximate\ncause under Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Cor-\nporation, 503 U. S. 258 (1992), and Anza v. Ideal Steel\nSupply Corp., 547 U. S. 451 (2006), because they (along\nwith other losing bidders) were \u201cimmediately injured\u201d by\npetitioners\u2019 scheme. 477 F. 3d, at 930\u2013932. Finally, the\nCourt of Appeals rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that re-\nspondents are not entitled to relief under RICO because\nthey did not receive, and therefore did not rely on, any\nfalse statements: \u201cA scheme that injures D by making\nfalse statements through the mail to E is mail fraud, and\nactionable by D through RICO if the injury is not deriva-\ntive of someone else\u2019s.\u201d Id., at 932.\n   With respect to this last holding, the Court of Appeals\nacknowledged that courts have taken conflicting views.\nBy its count, \u201c[t]hree other circuits that have considered\nthis question agree . . . that the direct victim may recover\nthrough RICO whether or not it is the direct recipient of\nthe false statements,\u201d ibid.

C. \u00a71962(c).\nThe Court did not address the question whether reliance by the plain-\ntiff is a required element of a RICO claim, the matter now before us.\nCf. 547 U. S., at 475\u2013478 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part) (reaching the question and concluding that reliance is not an\nelement of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud).\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason\nof a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue there-\nfor in any appropriate United States district court and\nshall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the\ncost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d\nSection 1962 contains RICO\u2019s criminal prohibitions.\nPertinent here is \u00a71962(c), which makes it \u201cunlawful for\nany person employed by or associated with\u201d an enterprise\nengaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce \u201cto\nconduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the con-\nduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of rack-\neteering activity.\u201d The term \u201cracketeering activity\u201d is\ndefined to include a host of so-called predicate acts, includ-\ning \u201cany act which is indictable under . . . section 1341\n(relating to mail fraud).\u201d \u00a71961(1)(B).\n   The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of\naction for treble damages to any person injured in his\nbusiness or property by reason of the conduct of a qualify-\ning enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of acts indictable\nas mail fraud. Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a\nperson, \u201chaving devised or intending to devise any scheme\nor artifice to defraud,\u201d uses the mail \u201cfor the purpose of\nexecuting such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.\u201d\n\u00a71341. The gravamen of the offense is the scheme to\ndefraud, and any \u201cmailing that is incident to an essential\npart of the scheme satisfies the mailing element,\u201d\nSchmuck v. United States, 489 U. S. 705, 712 (1989) (cita-\ntion and internal quotation marks omitted), even if the\nmailing itself \u201ccontain[s] no false information,\u201d id., at 715.\n   Once the relationship among these statutory provisions\nis understood, respondents\u2019 theory of the case is straight-\nforward. They allege that petitioners devised a scheme to\ndefraud when they agreed to submit false attestations of\ncompliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule to\nthe county. In furtherance of this scheme, petitioners\nused the mail on numerous occasions to send the requisite\n8        BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnotices to property owners. Each of these mailings was an\n\u201cact which is indictable\u201d as mail fraud, and together they\nconstituted a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d By con-\nducting the affairs of their enterprise through this pattern\nof racketeering activity, petitioners violated \u00a71962(c). As a\nresult, respondents lost the opportunity to acquire valu-\nable liens. Accordingly, respondents were injured in their\nbusiness or property by reason of petitioners\u2019 violation of\n\u00a71962(c), and RICO\u2019s plain terms give them a private right\nof action for treble damages.\n    Petitioners argue, however, that because the alleged\npattern of racketeering activity consisted of acts of mail\nfraud, respondents must show that they relied on petition-\ners\u2019 fraudulent misrepresentations. This they cannot do,\nbecause the alleged misrepresentations\u2014petitioners\u2019\nattestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous\nBidder Rule\u2014were made to the county, not respondents.\nThe county may well have relied on petitioners\u2019 misrepre-\nsentations when it permitted them to participate in the\nauction, but respondents, never having received the mis-\nrepresentations, could not have done so. Indeed, respon-\ndents do not even allege that they relied on petitioners\u2019\nfalse attestations. Thus, petitioners submit, they fail to\nstate a claim under RICO.\n    If petitioners\u2019 proposed requirement of first-party reli-\nance seems to come out of nowhere, there is a reason:\nNothing on the face of the relevant statutory provisions\nimposes such a requirement. Using the mail to execute or\nattempt to execute a scheme to defraud is indictable as\nmail fraud, and hence a predicate act of racketeering\nunder RICO, even if no one relied on any misrepresenta-\ntion. See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1999)\n(\u201cThe common-law requiremen[t] of \u2018justifiable reliance\u2019\n. . . plainly ha[s] no place in the [mail, wire, or bank] fraud\nstatutes\u201d). And one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying\nenterprise through a pattern of such acts without anyone\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrelying on a fraudulent misrepresentation.\n   It thus seems plain\u2014and indeed petitioners do not\ndispute\u2014that no showing of reliance is required to estab-\nlish that a person has violated \u00a71962(c) by conducting the\naffairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity consisting of acts of mail fraud. See Anza, 547\nU. S., at 476 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part) (\u201cBecause an individual can commit an indict-\nable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his\nfraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity,\nin violation of \u00a71962, without proof of reliance\u201d). If reli-\nance is required, then, it must be by virtue of \u00a71964(c),\nwhich provides the right of action. But it is difficult to\nderive a first-party reliance requirement from \u00a71964(c),\nwhich states simply that \u201c[a]ny person injured in his\nbusiness or property by reason of a violation of section\n1962\u201d may sue for treble damages. The statute provides a\nright of action to \u201c[a]ny person\u201d injured by the violation,\nsuggesting a breadth of coverage not easily reconciled with\nan implicit requirement that the plaintiff show reliance in\naddition to injury in his business or property.\n   Moreover, a person can be injured \u201cby reason of\u201d a pat-\ntern of mail fraud even if he has not relied on any misrep-\nresentations. This is a case in point. Accepting their\nallegations as true, respondents clearly were injured by\npetitioners\u2019 scheme: As a result of petitioners\u2019 fraud, re-\nspondents lost valuable liens they otherwise would have\nbeen awarded. And this is true even though they did not\nrely on petitioners\u2019 false attestations of compliance with\nthe county\u2019s rules. Or, to take another example, suppose\nan enterprise that wants to get rid of rival businesses\nmails misrepresentations about them to their customers\nand suppliers, but not to the rivals themselves. If the\nrival businesses lose money as a result of the misrepresen-\ntations, it would certainly seem that they were injured in\ntheir business \u201cby reason of\u201d a pattern of mail fraud, even\n10       BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthough they never received, and therefore never relied on,\nthe fraudulent mailings. Yet petitioners concede that, on\ntheir reading of \u00a71964(c), the rival businesses would have\nno cause of action under RICO, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, even\nthough they were the primary and intended victims of the\nscheme to defraud.\n   Lacking textual support for this counterintuitive posi-\ntion, petitioners rely instead on a combination of common-\nlaw rules and policy arguments in an effort to show that\nCongress should be presumed to have made first-party\nreliance an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail\nfraud. None of petitioners\u2019 arguments persuades us to\nread a first-party reliance requirement into a statute that\nby its terms suggests none.\n                               III\n                                A\n  Petitioners first argue that RICO should be read to\nincorporate a first-party reliance requirement in fraud\ncases \u201cunder the rule that Congress intends to incorporate\nthe well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it\nuses.\u201d Neder, supra, at 23. It has long been settled, they\ncontend, that only the recipient of a fraudulent misrepre-\nsentation may recover for common-law fraud, and that he\nmay do so \u201cif, but only if . . . he relies on the misrepresen-\ntation in acting or refraining from action.\u201d Restatement\n(Second) of Torts \u00a7537 (1977). Given this background rule\nof common law, petitioners maintain, Congress should be\npresumed to have adopted a first-party reliance require-\nment when it created a civil cause of action under RICO\nfor victims of mail fraud.\n  In support of this argument, petitioners point to our\ndecision in Beck v. Prupis, 529 U. S. 494 (2000). There, we\nconsidered the scope of RICO\u2019s private right of action for\nviolations of \u00a71962(d), which makes it \u201cunlawful for any\nperson to conspire to violate\u201d RICO\u2019s criminal prohibitions.\n                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThe question presented was \u201cwhether a person injured by\nan overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy may assert a\ncivil RICO conspiracy claim under \u00a71964(c) for a violation\nof \u00a71962(d) even if the overt act does not constitute \u2018rack-\neteering activity.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 500. Answering this question in\nthe negative, we held that \u201cinjury caused by an overt act\nthat is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful\nunder RICO is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of\naction under \u00a71964(c) for a violation of \u00a71962(d).\u201d Id., at\n505 (citation omitted). In so doing, we \u201cturn[ed] to the\nwell-established common law of civil conspiracy.\u201d Id., at\n500. Because it was \u201cwidely accepted\u201d by the time of\nRICO\u2019s enactment \u201cthat a plaintiff could bring suit for civil\nconspiracy only if he had been injured by an act that was\nitself tortious,\u201d id., at 501, we presumed \u201cthat when Con-\ngress established in RICO a civil cause of action for a\nperson \u2018injured . . . by reason of\u2019 a \u2018conspir[acy],\u2019 it meant\nto adopt these well-established common-law civil conspir-\nacy principles.\u201d Id., at 504 (quoting \u00a7\u00a71964(c), 1962(d);\nalterations in original). We specifically declined to rely on\nthe law of criminal conspiracy, relying instead on the law\nof civil conspiracy:\n    \u201cWe have turned to the common law of criminal con-\n    spiracy to define what constitutes a violation of\n    \u00a71962(d), see Salinas v. United States, 522 U. S. 52,\n    63\u201365 (1997), a mere violation being all that is neces-\n    sary for criminal liability. This case, however, does\n    not present simply the question of what constitutes a\n    violation of \u00a71962(d), but rather the meaning of a civil\n    cause of action for private injury by reason of such a\n    violation. In other words, our task is to interpret\n    \u00a7\u00a71964(c) and 1962(d) in conjunction, rather than\n    \u00a71962(d) standing alone. The obvious source in the\n    common law for the combined meaning of these provi-\n    sions is the law of civil conspiracy.\u201d Id., at 501, n. 6.\n12      BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners argue that, as in Beck, we should look to the\ncommon-law meaning of civil fraud in order to give content\nto the civil cause of action \u00a71964(c) provides for private\ninjury by reason of a violation of \u00a71962(c) based on a pat-\ntern of mail fraud. The analogy to Beck, however, is mis-\nplaced. The critical difference between Beck and this case\nis that in \u00a71962(d) Congress used a term\u2014\u201cconspir[acy]\u201d\u2014\nthat had a settled common-law meaning, whereas Con-\ngress included no such term in \u00a71962(c). Section 1962(c)\ndoes not use the term \u201cfraud\u201d; nor does the operative\nlanguage of \u00a71961(1)(B), which defines \u201cracketeering\nactivity\u201d to include \u201cany act which is indictable under . . .\nsection 1341.\u201d And the indictable act under \u00a71341 is not\nthe fraudulent misrepresentation, but rather the use of\nthe mails with the purpose of executing or attempting to\nexecute a scheme to defraud. In short, the key term in\n\u00a71962(c)\u2014\u201cracketeering activity\u201d\u2014is a defined term, and\nCongress defined the predicate act not as fraud simplic-\niter, but mail fraud\u2014a statutory offense unknown to the\ncommon law. In these circumstances, the presumption\nthat Congress intends to adopt the settled meaning of\ncommon-law terms has little pull. Cf. Stoneridge Invest-\nment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 552 U. S.\n___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 11) (rejecting the argument\nthat \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778j(b), incorporates common-law fraud). There is\nsimply no \u201creason to believe that Congress would have\ndefined \u2018racketeering activity\u2019 to include acts indictable\nunder the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended\nfraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only\nwhen those acts would have been actionable under the\ncommon law.\u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at 477\u2013478 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).\n   Nor does it help petitioners\u2019 cause that here, as in Beck,\nthe question is not simply \u201cwhat constitutes a violation of\n\u00a71962[(c)], but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor private injury by reason of such a violation.\u201d 529 U. S.,\nat 501, n. 6. To be sure, Beck held that a plaintiff cannot\nstate a civil claim for conspiracy under \u00a71964(c) merely by\nshowing a violation of \u00a71962(d) and a resulting injury.\nBut in so doing, Beck relied not only on the fact that the\nterm \u201cconspiracy\u201d had a settled common-law meaning, but\nalso on the well-established common-law understanding of\nwhat it means to be injured by a conspiracy for purposes of\nbringing a civil claim for damages. See id., at 501\u2013504.\nNo comparable understanding exists with respect to injury\ncaused by an enterprise conducting its affairs through a\npattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. And even the\ncommon-law understanding of injury caused by fraud does\nnot support petitioners\u2019 argument. As discussed infra, at\n16\u201317, the common law has long recognized that plaintiffs\ncan recover in a variety of circumstances where, as here,\ntheir injuries result directly from the defendant\u2019s fraudu-\nlent misrepresentations to a third party.\n   For these reasons, we reject petitioners\u2019 contention that\nthe \u201ccommon-law meaning\u201d rule dictates that reliance by\nthe plaintiff is an element of a civil RICO claim predicated\non a violation of the mail fraud statute. Congress chose to\nmake mail fraud, not common-law fraud, the predicate act\nfor a RICO violation. And \u201cthe mere fact that the predi-\ncate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to\nbe fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element\nof common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of\na civil RICO claim.\u201d Anza, supra, at 476 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part).\n                               B\n  Petitioners next argue that even if Congress did not\nmake first-party reliance an element of a RICO claim\npredicated on mail fraud, a plaintiff who brings such a\nclaim must show that it relied on the defendant\u2019s misrep-\nresentations in order to establish the requisite element of\n14       BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncausation. In Holmes, we recognized that \u00a71964(c)\u2019s \u201clan-\nguage can, of course, be read to mean that a plaintiff is\ninjured \u2018by reason of\u2019 a RICO violation, and therefore may\nrecover, simply on showing that the defendant violated\n\u00a71962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant\u2019s viola-\ntion was a \u2018but for\u2019 cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d 503 U. S., at\n265\u2013266 (footnote omitted). We nonetheless held that not\n\u201call factually injured plaintiffs\u201d may recover under\n\u00a71964(c). Id., at 266. Because Congress modeled \u00a71964(c)\non other provisions that had been interpreted to \u201crequir[e]\na showing that the defendant\u2019s violation not only was a\n\u2018but for\u2019 cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause\nas well,\u201d we concluded that \u00a71964(c) likewise requires the\nplaintiff to establish proximate cause in order to show\ninjury \u201cby reason of\u201d a RICO violation. Id., at 268.\n   Proximate cause, we explained, is a flexible concept that\ndoes not lend itself to \u201c \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate\nthe result in every case.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 272, n. 20 (quoting Asso-\nciated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459\nU. S. 519, 536 (1983)). Instead, we \u201cuse[d] \u2018proximate\ncause\u2019 to label generically the judicial tools used to limit a\nperson\u2019s responsibility for the consequences of that per-\nson\u2019s own acts,\u201d Holmes, 503 U. S., at 268, with a particu-\nlar emphasis on the \u201cdemand for some direct relation\nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged,\u201d ibid.; see also Anza, supra, at 461 (\u201cWhen a court\nevaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the\ncentral question it must ask is whether the alleged viola-\ntion led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s injuries\u201d).

In support of this\nargument, petitioners cite Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7548A, which provides that \u201c[a] fraudulent misrepresenta-\ntion is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from\naction or inaction in reliance upon it if, but only if, the loss\nmight reasonably be expected to result from the reliance.\u201d\nThus, petitioners conclude, \u201ca plaintiff asserting a civil\nRICO claim predicated on mail fraud cannot satisfy the\nproximate cause requirement unless he can establish that\nhis injuries resulted from his reliance on the defendant\u2019s\nfraudulent misrepresentation.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 28.\n   Petitioners\u2019 argument is twice flawed. First, as ex-\nplained above, the predicate act here is not common-law\nfraud, but mail fraud. Having rejected petitioners\u2019 argu-\nment that reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim\nbased on mail fraud, we see no reason to let that argument\nin through the back door by holding that the proximate-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Applying these principles in Holmes, the Court held that the Securi-\n\nties Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) could not recover for\ninjuries caused by a stock-manipulation scheme that prevented two\nbroker-dealers from meeting obligations to their customers, thereby\ntriggering SIPC\u2019s duty to reimburse the customers. 503 U. S., at 270\u2013\n274. And in Anza, the Court applied the principles of Holmes to pre-\nclude a company from recovering profits it allegedly lost when a rival\nbusiness was able to lower its prices because it failed to charge the\nrequisite sales tax on cash sales. 547 U. S., at 456\u2013461.\n16        BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncause analysis under RICO must precisely track the\nproximate-cause analysis of a common-law fraud claim.\n\u201cReliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in\ntort; it \u2018is a specialized condition that happens to have\ngrown up with common law fraud.\u2019 \u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at\n477 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (quoting Systems Management, 303 F. 3d, at 104).\nThat \u201cspecialized condition,\u201d whether characterized as an\nelement of the claim or as a prerequisite to establishing\nproximate causation, simply has no place in a remedial\nscheme keyed to the commission of mail fraud, a statutory\noffense that is distinct from common-law fraud and that\ndoes not require proof of reliance.\n   Second, while it may be that first-party reliance is an\nelement of a common-law fraud claim, there is no general\ncommon-law principle holding that a fraudulent misrepre-\nsentation can cause legal injury only to those who rely on\nit. The Restatement provision cited by petitioners cer-\ntainly does not support that proposition. It provides only\nthat the plaintiff\u2019s loss must be a foreseeable result of\nsomeone\u2019s reliance on the misrepresentation.6 It does not\nsay that only those who rely on the misrepresentation can\nsuffer a legally cognizable injury. And any such notion\nwould be contradicted by the long line of cases in which\ncourts have permitted a plaintiff directly injured by a\nfraudulent misrepresentation to recover even though it\nwas a third party, and not the plaintiff, who relied on the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In addition to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7548A (1977), petition-\n\ners cite Comment a to that section, which provides that \u201c[c]ausation, in\nrelation to losses incurred by reason of a misrepresentation, is a matter\nof the recipient\u2019s reliance in fact upon the misrepresentation in taking\nsome action or in refraining from it.\u201d Like \u00a7548A itself, however, the\ncomment does not support petitioners\u2019 argument. Of course, a misrep-\nresentation can cause harm only if a recipient of the misrepresentation\nrelies on it. But that does not mean that the only injuries proximately\ncaused by the misrepresentation are those suffered by the recipient.\n                     Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)                  17\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant\u2019s misrepresentation.7 Indeed, so well estab-\nlished is the defendant\u2019s liability in such circumstances\nthat the Restatement (Second) of Torts sets forth as a\n\u201c[g]eneral [p]rinciple\u201d that \u201c[o]ne who intentionally causes\ninjury to another is subject to liability to the other for that\ninjury, if his conduct is generally culpable and not justifi-\nable under the circumstances.\u201d \u00a7870. As an illustration,\nthe Restatement provides the example of a defendant who\n\u201cseeks to promote his own interests by telling a known\nfalsehood to or about the plaintiff or his product.\u201d Id.,\nComment h (emphasis added). And the Restatement\nspecifically recognizes \u201ca cause of action\u201d in favor of the\ninjured party where the defendant \u201cdefrauds another for\nthe purpose of causing pecuniary harm to a third person.\u201d\nId., \u00a7435A, Comment a.         Petitioners\u2019 contention that\nproximate cause has traditionally incorporated a first-\nparty reliance requirement for claims based on fraud\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 Such cases include Rice v. Manley, 66 N. Y. 82 (1876) (permitting\n\nplaintiffs who had arranged to buy a large quantity of cheese to recover\nagainst a defendant who induced the vendor to sell him the cheese by\nfalsely representing to the vendor that plaintiffs no longer wished to\npurchase it); and Gregory v. Brooks, 35 Conn. 437 (1868) (permitting\nplaintiff wharf owner to recover against a defendant who, in order to\ndeprive plaintiff of business, misrepresented himself to be a superin-\ntendent of wharves and ordered a vessel unloading at plaintiff\u2019s wharf\nto leave); see also Brief for Respondents 26\u201329 (collecting cases).\n   Petitioners argue that these cases are irrelevant because they\nwould be treated today as specialized torts, such as wrongful interfer-\nence with contractual relations, rather than as common-law fraud. See,\ne.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7767, Comment c (recognizing that\n\u201cone [may be] liable to another for intentional interference with eco-\nnomic relations by inducing a third person by fraudulent misrepresen-\ntation not to do business with the other\u201d). But petitioners miss the\npoint. The cases are not cited as evidence that common-law fraud can\nbe established without showing first-party reliance. Rather, they\u2014\nalong with the Restatement\u2019s recognition of specialized torts based on\nthird-party reliance\u2014show that a fraudulent misrepresentation can\nproximately cause actionable injury even to those who do not rely on\nthe misrepresentation.\n18      BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncannot be reconciled with these authorities.\n   Nor is first-party reliance necessary to ensure that there\nis a sufficiently direct relationship between the defen-\ndant\u2019s wrongful conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury to satisfy\nthe proximate-cause principles articulated in Holmes and\nAnza. Again, this is a case in point. Respondents\u2019 alleged\ninjury\u2014the loss of valuable liens\u2014is the direct result of\npetitioners\u2019 fraud. It was a foreseeable and natural conse-\nquence of petitioners\u2019 scheme to obtain more liens for\nthemselves that other bidders would obtain fewer liens.\nAnd here, unlike in Holmes and Anza, there are no inde-\npendent factors that account for respondents\u2019 injury, there\nis no risk of duplicative recoveries by plaintiffs removed at\ndifferent levels of injury from the violation, and no more\nimmediate victim is better situated to sue. Indeed, both\nthe District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that\nrespondents and other losing bidders were the only parties\ninjured by petitioners\u2019 misrepresentations. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 17a; 477 F. 3d, at 931. Petitioners quibble with that\nconclusion, asserting that the county would be injured too\nif the taint of fraud deterred potential bidders from par-\nticipating in the auction. But that eventuality, in contrast\nto respondents\u2019 direct financial injury, seems speculative\nand remote.\n   Of course, none of this is to say that a RICO plaintiff\nwho alleges injury \u201cby reason of\u201d a pattern of mail fraud\ncan prevail without showing that someone relied on the\ndefendant\u2019s misrepresentations. Cf. Field v. Mans, 516\nU. S. 59, 66 (1995) (\u201cNo one, of course, doubts that some\ndegree of reliance is required to satisfy the element of\ncausation inherent in the phrase \u2018obtained by\u2019 \u201d in 11\nU. S. C. \u00a7523(a)(2)(A), which prohibits the discharge of\ndebts for money or property \u201cobtained by\u201d fraud). In most\ncases, the plaintiff will not be able to establish even but-\nfor causation if no one relied on the misrepresentation. If,\nfor example, the county had not accepted petitioners\u2019 false\n                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous\nBidder Rule, and as a result had not permitted petitioners\nto participate in the auction, respondents\u2019 injury would\nnever have materialized. In addition, the complete ab-\nsence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establish-\ning proximate cause. Thus, for example, if the county\nknew petitioners\u2019 attestations were false but nonetheless\npermitted them to participate in the auction, then argua-\nbly the county\u2019s actions would constitute an intervening\ncause breaking the chain of causation between petitioners\u2019\nmisrepresentations and respondents\u2019 injury.\n   Accordingly, it may well be that a RICO plaintiff alleg-\ning injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must estab-\nlish at least third-party reliance in order to prove causa-\ntion. \u201cBut the fact that proof of reliance is often used to\nprove an element of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, such as\nthe element of causation, does not transform reliance itself\ninto an element of the cause of action.\u201d Anza, 547 U. S., at\n478 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). Nor does it transform first-party reliance into an\nindispensable requisite of proximate causation. Proof that\nthe plaintiff relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations\nmay in some cases be sufficient to establish proximate\ncause, but there is no sound reason to conclude that such\nproof is always necessary. By the same token, the absence\nof first-party reliance may in some cases tend to show that\nan injury was not sufficiently direct to satisfy \u00a71964(c)\u2019s\nproximate-cause requirement, but it is not in and of itself\ndispositive. A contrary holding would ignore Holmes\u2019\ninstruction that proximate cause is generally not amena-\nble to bright-line rules.\n                               C\n  As a last resort, petitioners contend that we should\ninterpret RICO to require first-party reliance for fraud-\nbased claims in order to avoid the \u201cover-federalization\u201d of\n20      BRIDGE v. PHOENIX BOND & INDEMNITY CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntraditional state-law claims. In petitioners\u2019 view, respon-\ndents\u2019 claim is essentially one for tortious interference\nwith prospective business advantage, as evidenced by\nCount V of their complaint. Such claims have tradition-\nally been handled under state law, and petitioners see no\nreason why Congress would have wanted to supplement\ntraditional state-law remedies with a federal cause of\naction, complete with treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees,\nin a statute designed primarily to combat organized crime.\nSee Anza, supra, at 471\u2013475 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part); Beck, 529 U. S., at 496\u2013497.\nA first-party reliance requirement, they say, is necessary\n\u201cto prevent garden-variety disputes between local competi-\ntors (such as this case) from being converted into federal\nracketeering actions.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioners 3.\n   Whatever the merits of petitioners\u2019 arguments as a\npolicy matter, we are not at liberty to rewrite RICO to\nreflect their\u2014or our\u2014views of good policy. We have re-\npeatedly refused to adopt narrowing constructions of\nRICO in order to make it conform to a preconceived notion\nof what Congress intended to proscribe. See, e.g., National\nOrganization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249,\n252 (1994) (rejecting the argument that \u201cRICO requires\nproof that either the racketeering enterprise or the predi-\ncate acts of racketeering were motivated by an economic\npurpose\u201d); H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.,\n492 U. S. 229, 244 (1989) (rejecting \u201cthe argument for\nreading an organized crime limitation into RICO\u2019s pattern\nconcept\u201d); Sedima, S. P.

The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud must plead and prove that it relied on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that a showing of first-party reliance is not required, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2135</span> I</h2>\n<p>Each year the Cook County, Illinois, Treasurer's Office holds a public auction at which it sells tax liens it has acquired on the property of delinquent taxpayers.<sup>[1]</sup> Prospective buyers bid on the liens, but not in cash amounts. Instead, the bids are stated as percentage penalties the property owner must pay the winning bidder in order to clear the lien. The bidder willing to accept the lowest penalty wins the auction and obtains the right to purchase the lien in exchange for paying the outstanding taxes on the property. The property owner may then redeem the property by paying the lienholder the delinquent taxes, plus the penalty established at the auction and an additional 12% penalty on any taxes subsequently paid by the lienholder. If the property owner does not redeem the property within the statutory redemption period, the lienholder may obtain a tax deed for the property, thereby in effect purchasing the property for the value of the delinquent taxes.</p>\n<p>Because property acquired in this manner can often be sold at a significant profit over the amount paid for the lien, the auctions are marked by stiff competition. As a result, most parcels attract multiple bidders willing to accept the lowest penalty permissible\u00970%, that is to say, no penalty at all. (Perhaps to prevent the perverse incentive taxpayers would have if they could redeem their property from a winning bidder for less than the amount of their unpaid taxes, the county does not accept negative bids.) The lower limit of 0% creates a problem: Who wins when the bidding results in a tie? The county's solution is to allocate parcels \"on a rotational basis\" in order to ensure that liens are apportioned fairly among 0% bidders. App. 18.</p>\n<p>But this creates a perverse incentive of its own: Bidders who, in addition to bidding themselves, send agents to bid on their behalf will obtain a disproportionate share of liens. To prevent this kind of manipulation, the county adopted the \"Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule,\" which requires each \"tax buying entity\" to submit bids in its own name and prohibits it from using \"apparent agents, employees, or related entities\" to submit simultaneous bids for the same parcel.<sup>[2]</sup> App. 67. Upon registering for an auction, each bidder must submit a sworn affidavit affirming that it complies with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule.</p>\n<p>Petitioners and respondents are regular participants in Cook County's tax sales. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2136</span> In July 2005, respondents filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, contending that petitioners had fraudulently obtained a disproportionate share of liens by violating the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule at the auctions held from 2002 to 2005. According to respondents, petitioner Sabre Group, LLC, and its principal Barrett Rochman arranged for related firms to bid on Sabre Group's behalf and directed them to file false attestations that they complied with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule. Having thus fraudulently obtained the opportunity to participate in the auction, the related firms collusively bid on the same properties at a 0% rate. As a result, when the county allocated liens on a rotating basis,<sup>[3]</sup> it treated the related firms as independent entities, allowing them collectively to acquire a greater number of liens than would have been granted to a single bidder acting alone. The related firms then purchased the liens and transferred the certificates of purchase to Sabre Group. In this way, respondents allege, petitioners deprived them and other bidders of their fair share of liens and the attendant financial benefits.</p>\n<p>Respondents' complaint contains five counts. Counts I-IV allege that petitioners violated and conspired to violate RICO by conducting their affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity involving numerous acts of mail fraud. In support of their allegations of mail fraud, respondents assert that petitioners \"mailed or caused to be mailed hundreds of mailings in furtherance of the scheme,\" App. 49, when they sent property owners various notices required by Illinois law. Count V alleges a state-law claim of tortious interference with prospective business advantage.</p>\n<p>On petitioners' motion, the District Court dismissed respondents' RICO claims for lack of standing. It observed that \"[o]nly [respondents] and other competing buyers, as opposed to the Treasurer or the property owners, would suffer a financial loss from a scheme to violate the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a. But it concluded that respondents \"are not in the class of individuals protected by the mail fraud statute, and therefore are not within the `zone of interests' that the RICO statute protects,\" because they \"were not recipients of the alleged misrepresentations and, at best were indirect victims of the alleged fraud.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 18a. The District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents' tortious-interference claim and dismissed it without prejudice.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. It first concluded that \"[s]tanding is not a problem in this suit\" because plaintiffs suffered a \"real injury\" when they lost the valuable chance to acquire more liens, and because \"that injury can be redressed by damages.\" 477 F.3d <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2137</span> 928, 930 (2007). The Court of Appeals next concluded that respondents had sufficiently alleged proximate cause under <i>Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporatio/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992), and <i>Anza v.

Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' argument that respondents are not entitled to relief under RICO because they did not receive, and therefore did not rely on, any false statements: \"A scheme that injures D by making false statements through the mail to E is mail fraud, and actionable by D through RICO if the injury is not derivative of someone else's.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 932.</p>\n<p>With respect to this last holding, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that courts have taken conflicting views.

RICO's private right of action is contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c), which provides in relevant part that \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\" Section 1962 contains RICO's criminal prohibitions. Pertinent here is \u00a7 1962(c), which makes it \"unlawful for any person employed by or associated with\" an enterprise <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2138</span> engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce \"to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\" The term \"racketeering activity\" is defined to include a host of so-called predicate acts, including \"any act which is indictable under. . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud).\" \u00a7 1961(1)(B).</p>\n<p>The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of action for treble damages to any person injured in his business or property by reason of the conduct of a qualifying enterprise's affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. Mail fraud, in turn, occurs whenever a person, \"having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\" uses the mail \"for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.\" \u00a7 1341. The gravamen of the offense is the scheme to defraud, and any \"mailing that is incident to an essential part of the scheme satisfies the mailing element,\" <i>Schmuck v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112222\"><a href=\"/opinion/112222/schmuck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 712, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), even if the mailing itself \"contain[s] no false information,\" <i>id.,</i> at 715, 109 S.Ct. 1443.</p>\n<p>Once the relationship among these statutory provisions is understood, respondents' theory of the case is straightforward. They allege that petitioners devised a scheme to defraud when they agreed to submit false attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule to the county. In furtherance of this scheme, petitioners used the mail on numerous occasions to send the requisite notices to property owners. Each of these mailings was an \"act which is indictable\" as mail fraud, and together they constituted a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" By conducting the affairs of their enterprise through this pattern of racketeering activity, petitioners violated \u00a7 1962(c). As a result, respondents lost the opportunity to acquire valuable liens. Accordingly, respondents were injured in their business or property by reason of petitioners' violation of \u00a7 1962(c), and RICO's plain terms give them a private right of action for treble damages.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue, however, that because the alleged pattern of racketeering activity consisted of acts of mail fraud, respondents must show that they relied on petitioners' fraudulent misrepresentations. This they cannot do, because the alleged misrepresentations\u0097petitioners' attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule\u0097were made to the county, not respondents. The <i>county</i> may well have relied on petitioners' misrepresentations when it permitted them to participate in the auction, but <i>respondents,</i> never having received the misrepresentations, could not have done so. Indeed, respondents do not even allege that they relied on petitioners' false attestations. Thus, petitioners submit, they fail to state a claim under RICO.</p>\n<p>If petitioners' proposed requirement of first-party reliance seems to come out of nowhere, there is a reason: Nothing on the face of the relevant statutory provisions imposes such a requirement. Using the mail to execute or attempt to execute a scheme to defraud is indictable as mail fraud, and hence a predicate act of racketeering under RICO, even if no one relied on any misrepresentation. See <i>Neder v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118298\"><a href=\"/opinion/118298/neder-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 24-25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (\"The common-law requiremen[t] of `justifiable reliance'. . . plainly ha[s] no place in the [mail, wire, or bank] fraud statutes\"). And one can conduct the affairs of a qualifying enterprise through a pattern of such acts <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2139</span> without anyone relying on a fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p>It thus seems plain\u0097and indeed petitioners do not dispute\u0097that no showing of reliance is required to establish that a person has violated \u00a7 1962(c) by conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of acts of mail fraud. See <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 476, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Because an individual can commit an indictable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of \u00a7 1962, without proof of reliance\"). If reliance is required, then, it must be by virtue of \u00a7 1964(c), which provides the right of action. But it is difficult to derive a first-party reliance requirement from \u00a7 1964(c), which states simply that \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962\" may sue for treble damages. The statute provides a right of action to \"[a]ny person\" injured by the violation, suggesting a breadth of coverage not easily reconciled with an implicit requirement that the plaintiff show reliance in addition to injury in his business or property.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a person can be injured \"by reason of\" a pattern of mail fraud even if he has not relied on any misrepresentations. This is a case in point. Accepting their allegations as true, respondents clearly were injured by petitioners' scheme: As a result of petitioners' fraud, respondents lost valuable liens they otherwise would have been awarded. And this is true even though they did not rely on petitioners' false attestations of compliance with the county's rules. Or, to take another example, suppose an enterprise that wants to get rid of rival businesses mails misrepresentations about them to their customers and suppliers, but not to the rivals themselves. If the rival businesses lose money as a result of the misrepresentations, it would certainly seem that they were injured in their business \"by reason of\" a pattern of mail fraud, even though they never received, and therefore never relied on, the fraudulent mailings. Yet petitioners concede that, on their reading of \u00a7 1964(c), the rival businesses would have no cause of action under RICO, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, even though they were the primary and intended victims of the scheme to defraud.</p>\n<p>Lacking textual support for this counterintuitive position, petitioners rely instead on a combination of common-law rules and policy arguments in an effort to show that Congress should be presumed to have made first-party reliance an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud. None of petitioners' arguments persuades us to read a first-party reliance requirement into a statute that by its terms suggests none.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioners first argue that RICO should be read to incorporate a first-party reliance requirement in fraud cases \"under the rule that Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\" <i>Neder, supra,</i> at 23, 119 S.Ct. 1827. It has long been settled, they contend, that only the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation may recover for common-law fraud, and that he may do so \"if, but only if . . . he relies on the misrepresentation in acting or refraining from action.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 537 (1977). Given this background rule of common law, petitioners maintain, Congress should be presumed to have adopted a first-party reliance requirement when it created a civil cause of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2140</span> action under RICO for victims of mail fraud.</p>\n<p>In support of this argument, petitioners point to our decision in <i>Beck v. Prupis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118360\"><a href=\"/opinion/118360/beck-v-prupis/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000). There, we considered the scope of RICO's private right of action for violations of \u00a7 1962(d), which makes it \"unlawful for any person to conspire to violate\" RICO's criminal prohibitions. The question presented was \"whether a person injured by an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy may assert a civil RICO conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d) even if the overt act does not constitute `racketeering activity.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 500, 120 S.Ct. 1608. Answering this question in the negative, we held that \"injury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d).\" <i>Id.,</i> at 505, 120 S.Ct. 1608 (citation omitted). In so doing, we \"turn[ed] to the well-established common law of civil conspiracy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 500, 120 S.Ct. 1608. Because it was \"widely accepted\" by the time of RICO's enactment \"that a plaintiff could bring suit for civil conspiracy only if he had been injured by an act that was itself tortious,\" <i>id.,</i> at 501, 120 S.Ct. 1608, we presumed \"that when Congress established in RICO a civil cause of action for a person `injured . . . by reason of' a `conspir[acy],' it meant to adopt these well-established common-law civil conspiracy principles.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 504, 120 S.Ct. 1608 (quoting \u00a7\u00a7 1964(c), 1962(d); alterations in original). We specifically declined to rely on the law of criminal conspiracy, relying instead on the law of civil conspiracy:</p>\n<blockquote>\"We have turned to the common law of criminal conspiracy to define what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962(d), see <i>Salinas v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118151\"><a href=\"/opinion/118151/salinas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 63-65[, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352] (1997), a mere violation being all that is necessary for criminal liability. This case, however, does not present simply the question of what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962(d), but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation. In other words, our task is to interpret \u00a7\u00a7 1964(c) and 1962(d) in conjunction, rather than \u00a7 1962(d) standing alone. The obvious source in the common law for the combined meaning of these provisions is the law of civil conspiracy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 501, n. 6, 120 S.Ct. 1608.</blockquote>\n<p>Petitioners argue that, as in <i>Beck,</i> we should look to the common-law meaning of civil fraud in order to give content to the civil cause of action \u00a7 1964(c) provides for private injury by reason of a violation of \u00a7 1962(c) based on a pattern of mail fraud. The analogy to <i>Beck,</i> however, is misplaced. The critical difference between <i>Beck</i> and this case is that in \u00a7 1962(d) Congress used a term\u0097\"conspir[acy]\"\u0097 that had a settled common-law meaning, whereas Congress included no such term in \u00a7 1962(c). Section 1962(c) does not use the term \"fraud\"; nor does the operative language of \u00a7 1961(1)(B), which defines \"racketeering activity\" to include \"any act which is indictable under . . . section 1341.\" And the indictable act under \u00a7 1341 is not the fraudulent misrepresentation, but rather the use of the mails with the purpose of executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud. In short, the key term in \u00a7 1962(c)\u0097\"racketeering activity\"\u0097is a <i>defined</i> term, and Congress defined the predicate act not as fraud <i>simpliciter,</i> but mail fraud\u0097a statutory offense unknown to the common law. In these circumstances, the presumption that Congress intends to adopt the settled meaning of common-law terms has little pull. Cf. <i>Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc.,</i> 552 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2141</span> ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 761, 773, 169 L.Ed.2d 627 (2008) (rejecting the argument that \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), incorporates common-law fraud). There is simply no \"reason to believe that Congress would have defined `racketeering activity' to include acts indictable under the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only when those acts would have been actionable under the common law.\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 477-478, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Nor does it help petitioners' cause that here, as in <i>Beck,</i> the question is not simply \"what constitutes a violation of \u00a7 1962[(c)], but rather the meaning of a civil cause of action for private injury by reason of such a violation.\" 529 U.S., at 501, n. 6, 120 S.Ct. 1608. To be sure, <i>Beck</i> held that a plaintiff cannot state a civil claim for conspiracy under \u00a7 1964(c) merely by showing a violation of \u00a7 1962(d) and a resulting injury. But in so doing, <i>Beck</i> relied not only on the fact that the term \"conspiracy\" had a settled common-law meaning, but also on the well-established common-law understanding of what it means to be injured by a conspiracy for purposes of bringing a civil claim for damages. See <i>id.,</i> at 501-504, 120 S.Ct. 1608. No comparable understanding exists with respect to injury caused by an enterprise conducting its affairs through a pattern of acts indictable as mail fraud. And even the common-law understanding of injury caused by fraud does not support petitioners' argument. As discussed <i>infra,</i> at 2142-2143, the common law has long recognized that plaintiffs can recover in a variety of circumstances where, as here, their injuries result directly from the defendant's fraudulent misrepresentations to a third party.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we reject petitioners' contention that the \"common-law meaning\" rule dictates that reliance by the plaintiff is an element of a civil RICO claim predicated on a violation of the mail fraud statute. Congress chose to make mail fraud, not common-law fraud, the predicate act for a RICO violation. And \"the mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim.\" <i>Anza, supra,</i> at 476, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioners next argue that even if Congress did not make first-party reliance an element of a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud, a plaintiff who brings such a claim must show that it relied on the defendant's misrepresentations in order to establish the requisite element of causation. In <i>Holmes,</i> we recognized that \u00a7 1964(c)'s \"language can, of course, be read to mean that a plaintiff is injured `by reason of a RICO violation, and therefore may recover, simply on showing that the defendant violated \u00a7 1962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant's violation was a `but for' cause of plaintiff's injury.\" 503 U.S., at 265-266, 112 S.Ct. 1311 (footnote omitted). We nonetheless held that not \"all factually injured plaintiffs\" may recover under \u00a7 1964(c). <i>Id.,</i> at 266, 112 S.Ct. 1311. Because Congress modeled \u00a7 1964(c) on other provisions that had been interpreted to \"requir[e] a showing that the defendant's violation not only was a `but for' cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well,\" we concluded that \u00a7 1964(c) likewise requires the plaintiff to establish proximate cause in order to show injury \"by reason of\" a RICO violation. <i>Id.,</i> at 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2142</span> Proximate cause, we explained, is a flexible concept that does not lend itself to \"`a black-letter rule that will dictate the result in every case.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 272, n. 20, 112 S.Ct. 1311 (quoting <i>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110831\"><a href=\"/opinion/110831/associated-gen-contractors-of-cal-inc-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 536, 103 S.Ct. 897, 74 L.Ed.2d 723 (1983)). Instead, we \"use[d] `proximate cause' to label generically the judicial tools used to limit a person's responsibility for the consequences of that person's own acts,\" <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S., at 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, with a particular emphasis on the \"demand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,\" <i>ibid.;</i> see also <i>Anza, supra,</i> at 461, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (\"When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries\"). The direct-relation requirement avoids the difficulties associated with attempting \"to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors,\" <i>Holmes,</i> 503 U.S., at 269, 112 S.Ct. 1311; prevents courts from having \"to adopt complicated rules of apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries,\" <i>ibid.;</i> and recognizes the fact that \"directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely,\" <i>id.,</i> at 269-270, 112 S.Ct. 1311.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Pointing to our reliance on common-law proximate-causation principles in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> petitioners argue that \"[u]nder well-settled common-law principles, proximate cause is established for fraud claims only where the plaintiff can demonstrate that he relied on the misrepresentation.\" Brief for Petitioners 28. In support of this argument, petitioners cite Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 548A, which provides that \"[a] fraudulent misrepresentation is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from action or inaction in reliance upon it if, but only if, the loss might reasonably be expected to result from the reliance.\" Thus, petitioners conclude, \"a plaintiff asserting a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud cannot satisfy the proximate cause requirement unless he can establish that his injuries resulted from his reliance on the defendant's fraudulent misrepresentation.\" Brief for Petitioners 28.</p>\n<p>Petitioners' argument is twice flawed. First, as explained above, the predicate act here is not common-law fraud, but mail fraud. Having rejected petitioners' argument that reliance is an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud, we see no reason to let that argument in through the back door by holding that the proximate-cause analysis under RICO must precisely track the proximate-cause analysis of a common-law fraud claim. \"Reliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it `is a specialized condition that happens to have grown up with common law fraud.'\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 477, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2143</span> in part) (quoting <i>Systems Management,</i> 303 F.3d, at 104). That \"specialized condition,\" whether characterized as an element of the claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, simply has no place in a remedial scheme keyed to the commission of mail fraud, a statutory offense that is distinct from common-law fraud and that does not require proof of reliance.</p>\n<p>Second, while it may be that first-party reliance is an element of a common-law fraud claim, there is no general common-law principle holding that a fraudulent misrepresentation can cause legal injury only to those who rely on it. The Restatement provision cited by petitioners certainly does not support that proposition. It provides only that the plaintiff's loss must be a foreseeable result of <i>someone's</i> reliance on the misrepresentation.<sup>[6]</sup> It does not say that only those who rely on the misrepresentation can suffer a legally cognizable injury. And any such notion would be contradicted by the long line of cases in which courts have permitted a plaintiff directly injured by a fraudulent misrepresentation to recover even though it was a third party, and not the plaintiff, who relied on the defendant's misrepresentation.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, so well established is the defendant's liability in such circumstances that the Restatement (Second) of Torts sets forth as a \"[g]eneral [p]rinciple\" that \"[o]ne who intentionally causes injury to another is subject to liability to the other for that injury, if his conduct is generally culpable and not justifiable under the circumstances.\" \u00a7 870. As an illustration, the Restatement provides the example of a defendant who \"seeks to promote his own interests by telling a known falsehood to <i>or about</i> the plaintiff or his product.\" <i>Id.,</i> Comment <i>h</i> (emphasis added). And the Restatement specifically recognizes \"a cause of action\" in favor of the injured party where the defendant \"defrauds another for the purpose of causing pecuniary harm to a third person.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 435A, Comment <i>a.</i> Petitioners' contention that proximate cause has traditionally incorporated <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2144</span> a first-party reliance requirement for claims based on fraud cannot be reconciled with these authorities.</p>\n<p>Nor is first-party reliance necessary to ensure that there is a sufficiently direct relationship between the defendant's wrongful conduct and the plaintiff's injury to satisfy the proximate-cause principles articulated in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza.</i> Again, this is a case in point. Respondents' alleged injury\u0097the loss of valuable liens\u0097is the direct result of petitioners' fraud. It was a foreseeable and natural consequence of petitioners' scheme to obtain more liens for themselves that other bidders would obtain fewer liens. And here, unlike in <i>Holmes</i> and <i>Anza,</i> there are no independent factors that account for respondents' injury, there is no risk of duplicative recoveries by plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violation, and no more immediate victim is better situated to sue. Indeed, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that respondents and other losing bidders were the <i>only</i> parties injured by petitioners' misrepresentations. App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a; 477 F.3d, at 931. Petitioners quibble with that conclusion, asserting that the county would be injured too if the taint of fraud deterred potential bidders from participating in the auction. But that eventuality, in contrast to respondents' direct financial injury, seems speculative and remote.</p>\n<p>Of course, none of this is to say that a RICO plaintiff who alleges injury \"by reason of\" a pattern of mail fraud can prevail without showing that <i>someone</i> relied on the defendant's misrepresentations. Cf. <i>Field v. Mans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117980\"><a href=\"/opinion/117980/field-v-mans/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 66, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (\"No one, of course, doubts that some degree of reliance is required to satisfy the element of causation inherent in the phrase `obtained by'\" in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), which prohibits the discharge of debts for money or property \"obtained by\" fraud). In most cases, the plaintiff will not be able to establish even but-for causation if no one relied on the misrepresentation. If, for example, the county had not accepted petitioners' false attestations of compliance with the Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule, and as a result had not permitted petitioners to participate in the auction, respondents' injury would never have materialized. In addition, the complete absence of reliance may prevent the plaintiff from establishing proximate cause. Thus, for example, if the county knew petitioners' attestations were false but nonetheless permitted them to participate in the auction, then arguably the county's actions would constitute an intervening cause breaking the chain of causation between petitioners' misrepresentations and respondents' injury.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it may well be that a RICO plaintiff alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at least third-party reliance in order to prove causation. \"But the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff's cause of action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action.\" <i>Anza,</i> 547 U.S., at 478, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Nor does it transform first-party reliance into an indispensable requisite of proximate causation. Proof that the plaintiff relied on the defendant's misrepresentations may in some cases be sufficient to establish proximate cause, but there is no sound reason to conclude that such proof is always necessary. By the same token, the absence of first-party reliance may in some cases tend to show that an injury was not sufficiently direct to satisfy \u00a7 1964(c)'s proximate-cause requirement, but it is not in and of itself dispositive. A contrary holding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2145</span> would ignore <i>Holmes</i>' instruction that proximate cause is generally not amenable to bright-line rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As a last resort, petitioners contend that we should interpret RICO to require first-party reliance for fraud-based claims in order to avoid the \"over-federalization\" of traditional state-law claims. In petitioners' view, respondents' claim is essentially one for tortious interference with prospective business advantage, as evidenced by Count V of their complaint. Such claims have traditionally been handled under state law, and petitioners see no reason why Congress would have wanted to supplement traditional state-law remedies with a federal cause of action, complete with treble damages and attorney's fees, in a statute designed primarily to combat organized crime. See <i>Anza, supra,</i> at 471-475, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>Beck,</i> 529 U.S., at 496-497, 120 S.Ct. 1608. A first-party reliance requirement, they say, is necessary \"to prevent garden-variety disputes between local competitors (such as this case) from being converted into federal racketeering actions.\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 3.</p>\n<p>Whatever the merits of petitioners' arguments as a policy matter, we are not at liberty to rewrite RICO to reflect their\u0097 or our\u0097views of good policy. We have repeatedly refused to adopt narrowing constructions of RICO in order to make it conform to a preconceived notion of what Congress intended to proscribe. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112923\"><a href=\"/opinion/112923/national-organization-for-women-inc-v-scheidler/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 252, 114 S.Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed.2d 99 (1994) (rejecting the argument that \"RICO requires proof that either the racketeering enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering were motivated by an economic purpose\"); <i>H.J.

RICO's text provides no basis for imposing a first-party reliance requirement. If the absence of such a requirement leads to the undue proliferation of RICO suits, the \"correction must lie with Congress.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 499, 105 S.Ct. 3275. \"It is not for the judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations where Congress has provided it.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 499-500, 105 S.Ct. 3275.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud need not show, either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to establishing proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Because this case arises from the District Court's grant of petitioners' motion to dismiss, we \"accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in [respondents'] complaint.\" <i>Erickson v. Pardus,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Single, Simultaneous Bidder Rule provides that \"one tax buying entity (principal) may not have its/his/her/their actual or apparent agents, employees, or related entities, directly or indirectly register under multiple registrations for the <i>intended or perceived</i> purpose of having more than one person bidding at the tax sale at the same time for the <i>intended or perceived</i> purpose of increasing the principal's likelihood of obtaining a successful bid on a parcel.\" App. 67. The rule defines \"Related Bidding Entity\" as \"any individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, business organization, or other entity that has a shareholder, partner, principal, officer, general partner or other person or entity having an ownership interest in common with, or contractual relationship with, any other registrant.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It further provides that \"[t]he determination of whether registered entities are related, so as to prevent the entities from bidding at the same time, is in the <i>sole and exclusive discretion</i> of the Cook County Treasurer or her designated representatives.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Respondents' complaint does not elaborate on the county's rotational system. The Court of Appeals described it as follows: \"If X bids 0% on ten parcels, and each parcel attracts five bids at that penalty rate, then the County awards X two of the ten parcels. Winners share according to the ratio of their bids to other identical bids.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796908\"><a href=\"/opinion/796908/phoenix-bond-indemnity-co-and-bcs-services-inc-v-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span>, 929 (C.A.7 2007). Petitioners object that this description is not supported by the record and inappropriately \"inject[s] into the case an element of mathematical certainty that is missing from the complaint itself.\" Reply Brief for Petitioners 20. While a precise understanding of the county's system may be necessary to calculate respondents' damages, nothing in our disposition turns on this issue. For present purposes, it suffices that respondents allege they \"suffered the loss of property related to the liens they would have been able to acquire, and the profits flowing therefrom, had [petitioners] not implemented their scheme and acquired liens in excess of their appropriate share through their violation of the County Rule.\" App. 50.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Court considered a civil RICO claim predicated on mail fraud in its recent decision in <i>Anza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145652\"><a href=\"/opinion/145652/anza-v-ideal-steel-supply-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720. There the Court held that proximate cause is a condition of recovery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). The Court did not address the question whether reliance by the plaintiff is a required element of a RICO claim, the matter now before us. Cf. 547 U.S., at 475-478, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (reaching the question and concluding that reliance is not an element of a civil RICO claim based on mail fraud).</p>\n<p>[5]  Applying these principles in <i>Holmes,</i> the Court held that the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) could not recover for injuries caused by a stock-manipulation scheme that prevented two broker-dealers from meeting obligations to their customers, thereby triggering SIPC's duty to reimburse the customers. 503 U.S., at 270-274, 112 S.Ct. 1311. And in <i>Anza,</i> the Court applied the principles of <i>Holmes</i> to preclude a company from recovering profits it allegedly lost when a rival business was able to lower its prices because it failed to charge the requisite sales tax on cash sales. 547 U.S., at 456-461, 126 S.Ct. 1991.</p>\n<p>[6]  In addition to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 548A (1977), petitioners cite Comment <i>a</i> to that section, which provides that \"[c]ausation, in relation to losses incurred by reason of a misrepresentation, is a matter of the recipient's reliance in fact upon the misrepresentation in taking some action or in refraining from it.\" Like \u00a7 548A itself, however, the comment does not support petitioners' argument. Of course, a misrepresentation can cause harm only if a recipient of the misrepresentation relies on it. But that does not mean that the only injuries proximately caused by the misrepresentation are those suffered by the recipient.</p>\n<p>[7]  Such cases include <i>Rice v. Manley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></span> (1876) (permitting plaintiffs who had arranged to buy a large quantity of cheese to recover against a defendant who induced the vendor to sell him the cheese by falsely representing to the vendor that plaintiffs no longer wished to purchase it); and <i>Gregory v. Brooks,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></span> (1868) (permitting plaintiff wharf owner to recover against a defendant who, in order to deprive plaintiff of business, misrepresented himself to be a superintendent of wharves and ordered a vessel unloading at plaintiff's wharf to leave); see also Brief for Respondents 26-29 (collecting cases).\n</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that these cases are irrelevant because they would be treated today as specialized torts, such as wrongful interference with contractual relations, rather than as common-law fraud. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767, Comment <i>c</i> (recognizing that \"one [may be] liable to another for intentional interference with economic relations by inducing a third person by fraudulent misrepresentation not to do business with the other\"). But petitioners miss the point. The cases are not cited as evidence that common-law fraud can be established without showing first-party reliance. Rather, they\u0097along with the Restatement's recognition of specialized torts based on third-party reliance\u0097show that a fraudulent misrepresentation can proximately cause actionable injury even to those who do not rely on the misrepresentation.</p>\n\n</div>",
