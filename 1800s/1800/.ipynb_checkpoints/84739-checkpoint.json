This was an action brought by the assignee of a bond, against the assignor, upon a written assignment, in general terms. On the trial, <i>Ingersoll</i>, for the plaintiff, offered parol testimony to show, that the defendant had expressly guaranteed the payment of the bond. <i>W. Tilghman</i> objected, that as the contract of the parties was in writing, no parol testimony could be admitted, on a trial at law, to vary its expressions and import. <i>Ingersoll</i> replied, that wherever there is an oral misrepresentation at the time of a sale, or transfer, even though the principal bargain is reduced to writing, the misrepresentation may be proved. A Court of equity would, in such case, grant relief; and even the Courts of law are now accustomed to regard actions on the case, like the present, as bills in equity. <i>Moses</i> v. <i>M'Farlan</i>. 2 <i>Burr.</i> 1005. 1 <i>Dall.
