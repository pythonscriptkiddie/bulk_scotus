Moore</i>, of <i>Charleston</i>. The facts were these: <i>Moore</i>, being indebted to several persons in<i>Philadelphia</i>, remitted to <i>Redman Byrne</i>, a bill of exchange, dated the 13th of <i>November</i> 1800, drawn by <i>Joseph Byrne</i>, in favour of <i>Redman Byrne</i>, on <i>John Welsh</i>, at 60 days sight, for 1700 dollars; saying, in the letter that inclosed the bill, 'I will send the duplicate, in a few days, with directions what to do with it.' Accordingly, on the 22d of <i>November</i>, he wrote again to <i>Byrne</i>, ordering the following disposition of the bill:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To <i>Martin Bernard</i> 70<i>l</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To <i>Moore</i>, surviving partner of <i>Goldthwaite</i> 29 Dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To <i>Jesse Sharples</i> 400 Dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'To <i>M.

And, on the 26th of <i>December</i> 1800, he wrote to <i>Moore</i>, that the bill 'should be disposed of, as his last letter directed.' Subsequent to these communications, the plaintiff issued a foreign attachment, on which the present <i>scire facias</i> is grounded. <i>Byrne</i> informed <i>Moore</i>, of the occurrence, and called for instructions, on the 8th of <i>January</i> 1801; and on the 6th of <i>February</i> following, <i>Moore</i> answered, 'I would rather, if by any means you could have it done, that <i>Sharpless</i> should be got to put up with 8 or 900 dollars; and the rest to be paid to the other people mentioned, as far as it will go.' But <i>Byrne</i>, conceiving himself bound to pay, according to the first appropriation, did not mention this proposition to <i>Sharpless</i>. In the meantime, the bill of exchange, which had been accepted on the 28th of <i>November</i>, was regularly protested for non-payment; <i>Welsh</i> assigning the attachment, as the cause of his refusal to pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the trial of the cause, it was contended, <i>for the plaintiff</i>, that the property in the bill continued to be <i>Moore's</i>, at the time of the attachment; and that the creditors had acquired no lien upon it. 4 <i>Burr.</i> 2174. The letter of appropriation, is nothing more than a private order, to pay the money, when it was received; and <i>Moore</i> had a power to revoke, or alter it (as, in fact, he did, in his letter of the 6th of <i>February</i>) at any time before actual payment to the creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it was insisted, by the counsel <i>for the defendants</i>, that the letter of the 22d of <i>November</i>, amounted to an irrevocable appropriation and transfer of the fund; that <i>Byrne</i> became a trustee, for the creditors named in the letter; and that the trust fund was not liable to a foreign attachment. <i>Ambl.</i> 297. 1 <i>Atk.</i> 124. 2 <i>Atk.</i> 207. 1 <i>F. Vez.</i> 280. 1 <i>Vez.</i> 331, 2. 1 <i>East.</i> 550. 5 <i>T. Rep.</i> 215. 494.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">By the COURT:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff had a legal right to institute the attachment, which cannot be divested, by any irregular attempts to obtain a preference, from the trustee himself. The only question is, whether the fund attached, can be regarded, under the circumstances of this case, as the property of <i>Moore?</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are few, but powerful. <i>Moore</i> remits the bill to <i>Byrne</i>, with express directions to apply the money, to the payment of specific creditors in <i>Philadelphia;</i> and <i>Byrne</i> undertakes to do so. Independent of the communication to the plaintiff, <i>Byrne</i> mentioned the general appropriation to <i>Shields</i>, with a direct and positive promise, to pay <i>Shields</i> his proportion of the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, it is clear, that there could be no revocation of the appropriation, in favour of <i>Shields;</i> to whom <i>Byrne</i> himself had become responsible: but the doubt arises, as to the situation of those creditors, who had received no intimation of the remittance. If, indeed, no notice had been given to <i>any</i> of the creditors, we do not think that any of the creditors would have acquired a vested interest in the fund, by the terms of the correspondence between <i>Moore</i> and <i>Byrne</i>. But it is a material fact, for the consideration of the jury, that the plaintiff received information, not only of his own apportionment, but of the distributive shares of all the creditors; and that he never objected to this appropriation of the fund, until he issued his attachment. If the jury shall think, from this fact, that the plaintiff ratified, or acquiesced, in the distributive appropriation; the law will not permit him, afterwards to monopolize the fund, in the way, that the present suit contemplates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BRACKENRIDGE, <i>Justice</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equity of the case is strongly in favour of the defendants; but I find it difficult to surmount the strict rules of law, as to those creditors, who, receiving no notice, acquired no right. The creditors who received notice, and assented to the appropriation, had clearly a vested interest. But, I incline to think, the law in favour of the creditors stops there; unless the fact is sufficiently ascertained, to satisfy the jury, that the plaintiff, by his conduct, approved and assented to the whole appropriation, after he was fully apprised of it. That fact, the important one in the cause, if found affirmatively, by the jury, must be decisive in favour of the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day, succeeding that, upon which the charge was delivered, the jury returned to the bar, and declared, that they could not agree upon a verdict; proposing, at the same time, several legal questions, for the solution of the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BUT SMITH, <i>Justice</i>, observed, that it would, probably, extricate the jury from their embarassment, as well as relieve his own mind, to inform them, that since the adjournment, he had entirely changed his opinion, upon the principal legal point in the cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He said, that he had always thought it more honourable to retract an erroneous opinion, when the error was discovered, than to persist in it, upon the suggestions of a false and pernicious pride. He then declared, that on full reflection and research, during the recess, he had been convinced, that from the time of receiving <i>Moore's</i> letter, ordering specific payments, to the enumerated creditors, <i>Byrne</i> became a trustee for those creditors; and that the creditors thereupon acquired such an interest in the trust fund, as could not be divested, or affected by the plaintiff's attachment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury, having again retired, soon agreed upon a verdict, in favour of the plaintiff, for 400 dollars; being the sum to which he was entitled by the original appropriation of the bill of exchange.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The cause was tried at <i>Nisi Prius, Philadelphia</i>, on the 16t h of <i>June</i> 1803, before SMITH and BRACKENRIDGE, <i>Justices</i>.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> BRACKENRIDGE. <i>Justice</i>, expressed no opinion upon this occasion; but seemed, silently, to assent to the statement now made by Judge SMITH.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
