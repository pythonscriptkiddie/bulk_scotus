The question was, whether at the date of that deed Wilson had a good title to the slave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Gordon being the owner of the slave in 1784, made a verbal gift of him to the defendant Ramsay, who was then only eight years old, and possession accompanied the gift; the slave remained with the defendant and his mother, Mrs. Ramsay, in the family of Wilson, until the year 1790, when Mrs. Ramsay, (claiming the slave as residuary legatee under the will of Mrs. Gordon, under the idea that the parol gift to her son was void,) by deed of bargain and sale conveyed the slave to Wilson, in consideration of five shillings, 'and divers other good causes.' Wilson held possession of the slave under that deed until the year 1805, when the defendant took him away, and has ever since detained him. The defendant and his mother and the slave had continued to live in the family of Wilson from the year 1784 till the year 1805.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below, upon the plaintiff's motion, instructed the jury, 'that if such a verbal gift was made to the defendant of the said slave, and such possession given to him as aforesaid, the gift is void in law, and opposes no bar to the recovery of the plaintiff.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict and judgment in the court below being against the defendant, he brought his writ of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Youngs</i>, for the plaintiff in error,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Did not contend that the verbal gift of a slave could, under the laws of Virginia, give a good title, but that such a gift and five years' possession was a good title for a <i>defendant</i> in detinue, but not for a plaintiff, if his possession was wrongfully acquired. He contended that the defendant's title was confirmed by the operation of the act of assembly of Virginia, passed in 1787.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>E. J. Lee</i>, contra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If five years' possession is a good title to Ramsay, fifteen years' possession must be a good title in Wilson; and his possession being posterior to Ramsay's, must give him a better title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case of <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Turner</i>, 1 <i>Wash.</i> 139. is decisive that such a parol gift cannot be given in evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Youngs</i>, in reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possession of Wilson, in order to create a title, must at all events have been adverse; but his possession was the possession of Ramsay. They all lived in the same family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of <i>Jourdan</i> v. <i>Murray</i>, 3 <i>Call</i>, 85. it is decided by the court of appeals in Virginia, that a parol gift of slaves prior to 1787 may be given in evidence to prove five years' possession, so as to bar the plaintiff's recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch. J. There is no question that five years' adverse possession, with or without right, gives a good title.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\"><i>March</i> 14.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MARSHALL, Ch.
